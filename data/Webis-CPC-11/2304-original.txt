Fortunately his illness was not of long continuance, and in the month
of December he was perfectly recovered. At this period an English expedition went from Senegal
into the interior of Africa, commanded by Major Peddie,[8] the gentleman who had given so great

after his departure; we sincerely lamented him.

On the 1st of January 1817, the colony of Senegal was surrendered to the French.
