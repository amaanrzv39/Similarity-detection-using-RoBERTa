Certainly they were liable to military service and presumably to that taxation which fell upon
Athenians at home. That they were not liable for the tribute which members of the Delian League
paid is clear from the fact that the assessments of places where cleruchs were settled immediately
went down considerably (cf. the Periclean cleruchies, 450-445); indeed, this follows from their
status as Athenian citizens, which is emphasized by the fact that they retained their membership
of deme and tribe.
