A member afterwards of the National Convention,
he was sent in mission to Lyons, where, instead of healing the wounds of the inhabitants, he
inflicted new ones. When, on the 15th of March, 1796, in the Council of Five Hundred, he pronounced
the oath of hatred to royalty, he added, that this oath was in his heart, otherwise no power
upon earth could have forced him to take it; and he is now a sworn subject of Napoleon the
First!  He pronounced the panegyric of Robespierre, and the apotheosis of Marat.  "The soul,"
said he, "was moved and elevated in hearing Robespierre speak of the Supreme Being with philosophical
ideas, embellished by eloquence;" and he signed the removal of the ashes of Marat to the temple
consecrated to humanity!  In September, 1797, he was, as a royalist, condemned to transportation
by the Directory; but in 1799 Bonaparte recalled him, made him first a tribune and afterwards
a Senator.

Boissy d' Anglas, though an apologist of robbers and assassins, has neither murdered nor plundered;

Sers, a third member of this commission, was, before the Revolution, a bankrupt merchant at
Bordeaux, but in 1791 was a municipal officer of the same city, and sent as a deputy to the
National Assembly, where he attempted to rise from the clouds that encompassed his heavy genius
by a motion for pulling down all the statues of Kings all over France.  He seconded another
motion of Bonaparte's prefect, Jean Debrie, to decree a corps of tyrannicides, destined to
murder all Emperors, Kings, and Princes.
