There was no single Inaccuracy in Sir George book.Two pretty Inscriptions the One an Epitaph, the other a Votive Table, which He has given Us, in a very corrupt Condition.Nor  i was in Greece, nor seen the Inscriptions but it is said in books .we can restore them to their true Sense and Numbers: .And, as they are particularly elegant. some Readers will not be displeasâ€™d to see them in a State of Purity.
