"Instead of a single person,
there is what is called the United States Signal Service, which has been in operation eight
or ten years, and comprises some two hundred or more men, scattered all over the country, from
Maine to California, and from the Gulf of Mexico away out to the Northwestern lakes. The men
at these various stations watch the weather very closely, and at a particular time every day
send word regarding it by telegraph to the main office at Washington, where the different reports
are carefully studied, and an opinion formed as to what the weather is likely to be in different
sections of the country during the next twenty-four hours or more, and the result is then published
in the daily newspapers and at the numerous post-offices throughout the land.
