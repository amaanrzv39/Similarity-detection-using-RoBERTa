The poet Campbell once wrote that "distance lends enchantment" to our view of the world. This view, at times buried with massive woods and village spires rising to the clouds and seen through the breathtaking, clear skies, is a sight to behold.

Another writer wrote quite the opposite point of view. He described the air as "crude and completely rotten." In "Polyolbion", Drayton spoke of the "sinful air and hellish soil," but that version of the world at large has long passed.
