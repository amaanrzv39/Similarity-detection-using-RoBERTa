Mallarm√© is obscure, not so much because he writes differently as because
he thinks differently from other people. His mind is elliptical, and (relying on the intelligence
of his readers) he emphasises the effect of what is unlike other people in his mind by resolutely
ignoring even the links of connection that exist between them. Never having aimed at popularity,
he has never needed, as most writers need, to make the first advances. He has made neither
intrusion upon nor concession to those who after all need not read him.
