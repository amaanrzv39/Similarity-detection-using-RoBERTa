Thrusting, prodding, and guarding, then, may be called the strong points of the gamp; it is
no use for hitting purposes, and invariably tumbles to pieces, comes undone, and gets into
a demoralized condition when one tries to make it fulfil all the conditions of the unclothed
walking-stick. Besides which, the handles are never made strong enough for hitting, and the
hittee is protected by the folds of silk.

Hitting, then, is the weak point of the gamp.
