This same Colonel Whittlesey, in a volume entitled Fugitive Essays, published a sketch of the
history of Cleveland covering the same ground more concisely, and also giving a few extra details
about the history between 1812 and 1840.

These constituted the sum total of works solely devoted to Cleveland which were accessible
to a writer in the East. The Ohio Historical Collections, by Henry Howe, a series of sketches
of the counties, cities, and towns of the State, added a little to the meagre stock of information.
