This message was sent by way of Brussels or Paris to the Intelligence Department of the German
Admiralty in Berlin and told them what warships were putting to sea or arriving at Rossyth.
The code contained such phrases as this:

"Current rumors."  "Incoming."  "Outgoing."  "Clearing for action." "Have lowered defending
nets."  "Land fortifications are manned." "Protective maneuvers are being carried out at sea."
"Coal being carried by rail."  "Remarkable influx of Reservists."  "Mine flelds being laid."
"All is quiet; nothing important to report."  "Liners are appearing."

The accidental finding of this code of course settled all further argument.  I called no witness
for the defense except two or three personal acquaintances to each of whom I put this question:

"What is your knowledge of my attitude as regards England?"

They all declared that even if I was a spy in the pay of any foreign government I certainly
had never shown any personal feeling or animosity toward Great Britain.

All of which I figured might aid the cause of clemency.  The jury was not out more than half
an hour.  I was found guilty of endangering the safeguards of the British Empire and under
the new law that had been aimed against German spies I was liable to seven years' penal servitude.
Even then my spirits were not down.  I had what Americans call "a hunch."

Just before his Lordship, the Chief Justice, summed up, an aristocratic, gray-clad Englishman,
who never had been in the court room before, appeared and was courteously, almost impressively,
conducted to the bench.  I noticed that the Chief Justice bowed to him with unction and they
had about two minutes' whispered conversation.
