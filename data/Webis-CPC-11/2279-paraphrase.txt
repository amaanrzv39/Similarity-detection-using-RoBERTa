The extraordinary conduct and the conversation with the little Simon Deg made the shoemaker to astonish. Simon Deg expressed his utmost uneasiness at their treading on the flowers in the grass. He told, he would burst with tears if they persisted in it. When asked why, he said they were so beautiful,that they must enjoy the sunshine, and be very unhappy to die.
      The shoemaker was amazed, but indulged the lad's fancy.
