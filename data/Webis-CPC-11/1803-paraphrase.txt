The same man who had chucked me out appeared, cheerily bowing like it was the first time I had ever met him and saying, "Ees bettah I rechistar ze loggij, Sarr, pity shentlemens like you, Sarr, rechistar ze loggij."

I turned my back to him in an impression that English natives would comprehend. Yet, he remained standing, gleeful and waiting for a tip, Let him be there.
