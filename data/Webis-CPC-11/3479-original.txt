It is not only
fit to exercise the intellectual faculties of a great people, and to contribute thereby to
the perfection of mankind, but it is also indispensable to all workmen, whose end is to give
to certain bodies determined forms, and it is principally owing to the methods of this art
having been too little extended, or in fact almost entirely neglected, that the progress of
our industry has been so slow. We shall contribute then to give an advantageous direction to
national education, by making our young artist familiar with the application of descriptive
geometry, to the graphic constructions which are necessary in the greater number of the arts,
and in making use of this geometry in the representation and determination of the elements
of machinery, by means of which, man by the aid of the forces of nature, reserves for himself,
in a manner, in his operations no other labour than that of his intellects. It is no less advantageous
to extend the knowledge of those phenomena of nature which may be turned to the profit of the
arts. The charm which accompanies them will overcome the repugnance that men have in general
for manual operations, (which most regard as painful and laborious,) as it will make them find
pleasure in the exercise of their intellect; thus there ought to be in the formal school a
course of descriptive geometry.

As yet we have no well compiled elementary work on that art, because till this time learned
men have taken too little interest in it, or it has only been practised in an obscure manner
by persons whose education had not been sufficiently extended, and were unable to communicate
the result of their lucubrations. A course simply oral would be absolutely without effect.
