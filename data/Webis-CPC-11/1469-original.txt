London saw many a hideous sight
in Henry's reign, but it had no cause to envy the Catholic capitals which witnessed the sack
of Rome and the massacre of St. Bartholomew; for all Henry's iniquities, multiplied manifold,
would not equal the volume of murder and sacrilege wrought at Rome in May, 1527, or at Paris
in August, 1572.[1178] From such orgies of violence and crime, England was saved by the strong
right arm and the iron will of her Tudor king.
