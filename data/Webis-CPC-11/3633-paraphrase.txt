Pigs are what they call them now. "Who owns them?"
"Pryderi owns them, and he sent them from Annwvyn's king." "How can we get them from him?" "I can go with twelve men disguised as minstrels and look for them." "But he won't even let you in the door," he said. "Don't worry I'll get the pigs back." "Alright, go then and get them."

He and Gilvaethwy went out together with ten men, and they came upon the city of Ceredigiawn. They were disguised as minstrels and everyone was happy to see them. Gwydion and Pryderi met that same night after dark.

"I'd really like to hear a tale from your men". "Alright I'll tell you about something amazing". He was the best teller of tales in the entire world, and enraptured the Court with his tales.

After these tales and much wine had been imbibed, Gwydion asked Pryderi if he could have the swine. "I'd let you have them except they are sacred to the land, and if I give them to you my kingdom is sure to crumble."
