On the top, at the reverse end, was a small flat piece like another oar blade, only broader and shorter, fixed at such an angle that when she sat down upon it the carved piece stood up slant-wise beside her. Halfway up the blade some colored cotton bands secured a bundle of flax, while in her hand she held a bobbin on to which she wove the thread. 
She was never inactive, for, when not occupied in singing to us, she spent her time spinning, always repeating, however, the second line of the other performers.
