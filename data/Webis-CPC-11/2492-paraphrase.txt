A great deal of pain, paralysis in the sight nerve, or death are possible causes of the abcess extending to the brain.

Orbital or periorbital abcess is treated similar to that of an abcess occuring in any other body part.  An opening is made to release the pus as soon as it is found to be an abcess. Later, in order to prevent septic infection of the ocular membranes, antiseptic solution made of boric acid or listerine 1 part to 10 of watermay be injected. If a high fever occurs, it is reccommended to give Glauber's salt (sulphate of soda) may be given one time a day in 4 oz. doses.
