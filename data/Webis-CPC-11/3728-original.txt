Miss ROSALIE TOLLER played the part with great charm and sympathy, and with a lightly-worn
grace and dignity that were pure English. Serving as a foil to her in taste and deportment
and social tradition, the Elsa Kolbeck of Miss DOLLY HOLMES-GORE was extraordinarily German--a
quite remarkable performance.

Miss MARIANNE CALDWELL as Frau Major Kolbeck, the hostess of Margaret, made a most lovable
drudge; and Miss DORA GREGORY had no difficulty in showing how the wife of a Prussian Colonel,
though in her husband's eyes her main purpose in life may be to minister to his inner man,
can wield an authority little less than that of the All-Highest over the wives of the regiment.
Female society in the little garrison town was further represented by Miss MAY HAYSACK and
Miss UNA VENNING, who played, with more than enough vivacity, a brace of giggling flappers,
very curious about the more private portion of the bride's trousseau.

Miss VANE FEATHERSTON, as Lady Lushington, had too little to do, and did it most humanly; and
Mr. OTHO STUART illustrated with a very natural ease the kind of simple friendship, as between
a man and a woman, which it takes an Anglo-Saxon intelligence to understand.

The officers, though there might have been more of the blond beast about them, were sufficiently
Prussian, and Mr. MALCOLM CHERRY, as Margaret's husband, indicated with much precision the
change in the behaviour of a German gentleman, after marriage, towards the lady he has consented
to honour with the thing he calls his heart.

Apart from the one or two doubtful points which I have referred to, the play went well, though
it seems a pity that so much insistence should have been laid upon the lack of culture (English
sense) in households where the strictest economy was essential.
