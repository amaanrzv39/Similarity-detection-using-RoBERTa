To St. Petersburg he ought go, the capital of skill, of aspiration, of hope, where are published the journals so readily eaten within the days gone by,--to the capital, whereas inhabit Zhukofsky and Pushkin. There his skills shall be recognized, and an understanding earth shall obtain the new-comer with open arms. The arms of the earth do indeed open onto his arrival at St. Petersburg, but it is the cold include of need, of friendlessness. In St. Petersburg initiates for him a competition for presence which well-nigh impairs him forever. Bread is not easily earned. Congenial culture does not readily seek him out, and the sympathetic recognition his starving soul craves is still as far as ever. Inevitable disappointment of hero-worship also hastily comes. When he calls at the door of the idolized Pushkin late within the morrow, he is told via the valet that the great man is deigning towards be unconscious at this late hour. "Ah, your master has been composing a number of heavenly tune everybody night!" "Not at all; he has been performing cards till seven within the morning!" And towards finalise his doom, his romantic susceptible heart initiates towards flutter with right severe ado at the sight of a dame of tall cultural grading whom barely deigns towards cast even a glance at the moneyless, ill-clad, clumsy, rustic lad,--sorrows adequate for a soul far better equipped for battle with Fortune than this destitute Cossak lad. Total impair is already dangerously nigh. And here Gogol becomes high-handed. He ought be off, away from this suffocation of disappointment and despair.
