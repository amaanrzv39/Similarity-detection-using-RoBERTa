The Plataea battle was brought to Greeks at unfavorable situation. The need and requirements for water  necessitated them to move on their part. The courage of all dependent and inflexibility of individual Spartan, made the whole plan upset. The Lacedaemonians and the Athenians were separated each other and  left  at daybreak. Mardonius attacked only once and prevented two allies. The Spartans revolted a Persian horse and slew Mardonius and were the first to assail the Persian camp. The Athenians defeated medizing Greeks, and effected a breach in defences of camp , on which Spartans had failed to make impression. A terrible massacre is followed. The contingent of 40,000 troops under Artabazus alone drew off in good order.
The remainder were seized with fear. They were killed like a sheep . 70,000 Greeks not only defeated but destroyed the army of 300,000 barbarians which melted and disappeared making no further stand. The disaster of Marathon was repeated on a larger scale and without the resource of embarkation.
