Usually I spoke of women with great caution (due to the fact that my girlfriends had lain in the house of my mother,being careful had now become a habit to me.) One evening I was talking about virgins and how to obtain one. Such things were done he told me; a young woman was had by the Harridans, for the right price, but usually the girls were sold repeatedly as virgins, "and," he added " those girls are trained, and there is no way to really know; you may be paying for one who really got fucked first by  a butcher boy, and after the butcher a dandy bought and paid for her virginity; you might actually pay for it boy, and not ever know you have been taken. I thought about this a lot, and brought up the subject again the next night. His idea was the himself being an old stager as himself was not to be done; however any horny young beggar would go up the girl, and gloat that he had had a virgin, if the girl was delightful and beautiful."When with your eye you see the tight covered hole, to your little finger it will be tight, and also to your cock tight; when your eye, cock, and finger have been satisfied, and actually seen blood on your cock, you will then be able to be sure that you have had a virgin.

I thought, " I am going to be deceived."
 A week later, with no letter, I went to her house, and discovered that she was gone and had taken all her belongings with her. That evening I spoke a little of my hopes to the Major, not giving the lady's identity, or telling where she had gone; and he laughed. " My boy you are done brown, you will never see her again."
