The Norman women would go to Granville weekly to dispose of their fowls, eggs, fruit, vegetables and fish.  They would seat at the stalls, and ply their needles when not serving the customers.  They had a very stern look and never condescended to solicit any person to deal with them-a mode of behaviour which the butchers, fishmongers, fruiterers, and greengrocers would try to imitate.
