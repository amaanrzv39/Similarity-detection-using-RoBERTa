It was decided to treat these stones
and gems the same because they all
are as hard as each other and they all
come from the same place, except the 
pearls, and they are like the bones of 
sea creatures.  Rubies, sapphires, and
topaz can all be classified alike, except
for their colors.

What Cellini always did was set the jewels
of varied hues in a golden closed box or in
a bezel, putting foil in back of them.
