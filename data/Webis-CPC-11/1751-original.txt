In Rome, before the Arch of Titus, she thought more of what she might acceptably
say about it than of any wonder or beauty in the thing itself. She fooled the honest man who
imagined he was in love with her by making herself, for the time, just what her fatal facility
for such perception told her he would most like her to be. The skill of the book is proved
by the increasing anxiety, and even agitation, with which one awaits the moment that shall
fulfil the title.
