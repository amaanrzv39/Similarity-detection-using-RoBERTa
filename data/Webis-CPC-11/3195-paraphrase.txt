I have a horse with rough looks, for the last four years. I must have suffered a lot due to this horse. But I was never disappointed and on the other hand trained him well for great speed. I only wish I could win this race and it will be a great landmark for me.

Satterlee was a very zealous racer and told me if I could let her ride in my place.

Lillie explained that she did not know what difficulties she may face during this drive.

I was much attracted to this woman, I don't know for what, although I think I had a dead heart. I did feel some kind of freshness and vitality in whatever she said. It was very different from normal ladies whom I met lately. Whatever she said made me merry and at the same time disagree with her ready to fight back but, instead, I was feeling bright but flexible.
