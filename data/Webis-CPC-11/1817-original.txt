The Leclanche is a fairly constant cell, which requires little attention. It "polarises" in
action but soon regains its normal strength when allowed to rest, and hence it is useful for
working electric bells and telephones. As shown in figure 16, it consists of a zinc rod with
its connecting wire Z, and a carbon plate C with its binding screw, between two cakes M M of
a mixture of black oxide of manganese, sulphur, and carbon, plunged in a solution of sal-ammoniac.
