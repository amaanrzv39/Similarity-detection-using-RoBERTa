There are variety of filaments are available in the name of protoplasmic processes.  But some other kinds of filament have been available in different name after its discoverer like the axis cylinder of Deiters. Actually it was based on a natural assumption and it is not clearly demonstrated on its related sections. The main object of such filamentous processes are that they are connecting some kind of links between the different nerve cells and also the channels of communication between nerve cells and the periphery of the body. Actually since the white substance of brain and cord is actually formed by such connecting fibers, it is capable to bring the different ganglion cells for making communication everywhere one with another.

Suppose if an attempt is made to trace the connecting nerve tracts through this white substance through two different methods such as macroscopically or microscopically, most important aids will be attained by a remarkable method which was invented by Waller in 1852.
