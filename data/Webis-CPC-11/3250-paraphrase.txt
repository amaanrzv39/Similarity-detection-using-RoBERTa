Currently Reverend John C. Emery is pastor. 

St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church was built in 1831 and replaced in 1854 by the new church. On October 29, 1854, the church was consecrated by Bishop Fitzpatrick of Boston and Bishop O'Riley of Hartford. Reverend John Mahoney, the Reverend Peter Connelly, the Reverend James T. McDermott, the Reverend Henry J. Tucker, and the Reverend John O'Brien were all past pastors. 

Under the ministry of Reverend Timothy Cole in 1833, a free church of the Christian denomination was organized. This experiment failed and the building was turned into an armory. 

In 1834 a Freewill Baptist Church was organized and a spacious edifice was erected following in 1837. The building was highly mismanaged and the building was used for commercial purposes after the society ended. The society built another edifice in 1853 on Paige Street. The Reverend Nathaniel Thurston, the Reverend Jonathan Woodman, the Reverend Silas Curtis, the Reverend A.D. Moulton, the Reverend J.B. Davis, the Reverend Darwin Mott, the Reverend George W. Bean, the Reverend J.B. Drew, the Reverend D.A. Marham, the Reverend J.E. Dame, and the Reverend E.W. Porter were all pasters of this church. 

In 1836 the Second Universalist Church was organized and their house was built the following year.
