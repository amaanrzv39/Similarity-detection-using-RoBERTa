This is a gratuitous insult even when applied to the pseudo-Christian or ecclesiastical Jehovite
idea of God.

Consequently, it will be seen that the common ideal conception of "Immortality" is not only
essentially wrong, but a physical and metaphysical impossibility. The idea, whether cherished
by Theosophists or non-Theosophists, by Christians or Spiritualists, by Materialists or Idealists,
is a chimerical illusion.  But the actual prolongation of human life is possible for a time
so long as to appear miraculous and incredible to those who regard our span of existence as
necessarily limited to at most a couple of hundred years.  We may break, as it were, the shock
of Death, and instead of dying, change a sudden plunge into darkness to a transition into a
brighter light.
