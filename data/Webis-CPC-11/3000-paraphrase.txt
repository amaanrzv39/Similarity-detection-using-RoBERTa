They can be scavengers, carnivores, or herbivores. Some paticular beetle species will prey on smaller insects, they will hunt together for big crustaceans, they will put their heads inside of snail shells to eat the inhabitant, or hunt for underground worms or slugs. The herbivores  aggressively eat woody items and leaves;often alternitive plant parts are eaten in the two different stages of life, for example the cockchafers, roots being gnawed by the grubs and the adults devouring leaves.
