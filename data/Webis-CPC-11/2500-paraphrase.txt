This little town was devastated by the sea and left in ruins.  The incoming boats must now go to Walderswick, a small village near Swole, because of the dangers of the debris left behind on the shore.  It became so perilous, some of the local fishermen made up a song about it.  

"Swoul and Dunwich, and Walderswick, all go in at one lousie creek."

This "lousie creek" is the river between the three.  The atlas maker, unaware of the tragic events, referred to this river as a good harbor and a naval substation, but soon this information soured his reputation.
