In the same pamphlet Sir Oliver Lodge makes a very striking estimate of the intrinsic energy
of the Ã¦ther. He says: "The total output of a million-kilowatt power station for thirty million
years exists permanently, and at present inaccessibly in every cubic millimetre of space."
Here again he is probably underestimating the stupendous truth.

It may naturally be asked how, if all this be so, it is possible that we can move about freely
in a solid ten thousand million times denser, as Sir Oliver Lodge says, than platinum. The
obvious answer is that, where densities differ sufficiently, they can move through each other
with perfect freedom; water or air can pass through cloth; air can pass through water; an astral
form passes unconsciously through a physical wall, or through an ordinary human body; many
of us have seen an astral form walk through a physical, neither being conscious of the passage;
it does not matter whether we say that a ghost has passed through a wall, or a wall has passed
through a ghost. A gnome passes freely through a rock, and walks about within the earth, as
comfortably as we walk about in the air. A deeper answer is that consciousness can recognize
only consciousness, that since we are of the nature of the LOGOS we can sense only those things
which are also of His nature. These bubbles are His essence, His life, and, therefore, we,
who also are part of Him, can see the matter which is built of his substance, for all forms
are but manifestations of Him.
