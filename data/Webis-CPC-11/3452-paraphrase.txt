Now Mr. William Sidney, the younger brother, who has five children, including his fortune was divided, these cousins had each only one-fifth of the confidence of Charles, and, of course, the wife of William Sidney was obliged to restrict many of its current indulgences in due proportion to their income. 

And yet, I have need to say that William, the eldest son, who was about the age of Charles, and their younger brothers and sisters, were a thousand times happier than his cousin, and, despite their limited means did more good to others in a month that Carlos did in a year. 

First, they were kind and generous to each other. A book, a toy, any source of gratification that he opened one, it was always the property of the whole family, so a gift or kindness of one of these children, it was as given in five. So girls, Fanny and Lucy, were so smart and industrious, they would make clothes for the poor, either by buying thick materials, but warm, with their own money, or get rid of his own clothes, your Mom gave them permission to use. Like all those who think more people than themselves, and they are constantly enjoy the pleasure of doing good, they are joyful and happy, while his cousin Charles, who thought only of their selfish interests, he spent three days out of four at the evil spirits and bad humor. 

"How I wish to stir the closet," said William one day his cousin, when he by chance have a look into its socket than it had accumulated. 

"Could you, by the way," said Charles, "I can tell you there is nothing there that are of lower profits. "
