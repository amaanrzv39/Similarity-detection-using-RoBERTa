In Java, and particularly
in Borneo and the Moluccas, the utensils in daily use are ornamented with so refined a feeling
for form and color, that they are praised by our artists as patterns of ornamentation and afford
a proof that the labor is one of love, and that it is presided over by an acute intelligence.
[Native art-sense spoiled.] Such a sense of beauty is seldom to be met with in the Philippines.
Everything there is imitation or careless makeshift. Even the pi√±a embroideries, which are
fabricated with such wonderful patience and skill, and are so celebrated for the fineness of
the work, are, as a rule, spiritless imitations of Spanish patterns. One is involuntarily led
to these conclusions by a comparison of the art products of the Spanish-American communities
with those of more barbarous races.
