MORE ALLEVIATIONS.

The late JAMES PAYN, who, as is well known, waged a merciless war against sham admiration in
literature, happened one day to hear me quote that tremendous fellow, SIBRANDUS SCHAFNABURGENSIS.

Mr. PAYN remarked sharply:--

"It would cost him some trouble to find one. I've never found a jolly chapter of RABELAIS in
my life, and what's more I mean to say so some day and watch the faces."

Well, Mr. PAYN believed in stating his own views truthfully. No doubt the necessity of finding
a rhyme for "Chablis" had something to do with the appearance of RABELAIS' name at the end
of that line.

I don't much care whether I have quoted correctly or not.
