The geographical range of the Arizona Jay is in southern New Mexico and Arizona and south into
Sonora and Chihuahua, Mexico. It is a common resident throughout the oak belt which generally
fringes the foothills of the mountains and ranges well up among the pines. In suitable localities
it is very abundant. It is rarely seen at any distance out of the arid plains; but after the
breeding season is over, small flocks are sometimes met with among the shrubbery of the few
water courses, several miles away from their regular habitat.
