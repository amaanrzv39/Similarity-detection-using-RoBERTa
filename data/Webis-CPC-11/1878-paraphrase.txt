For a very long time as they sat there, finally the old man stated"Will he die, Pierre?"
"I am afraid so" was the painful reply."But we shall see". Then came the early teaching to him,and he remarked:"Has the child been baptised?"

The old man ndded his head."Will you do it?"oblidged Pierre with hesistance.
"I can't--I Can't" was the answer.
Pierre laughes at the scene,as it was meant for him, took soem water in a mug, walked over, and said"Remember, Im a Baptist!"
