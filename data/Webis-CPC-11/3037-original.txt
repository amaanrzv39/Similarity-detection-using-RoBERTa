We trust her so completely that "safe as the Bank of England" has passed into a proverb; yet,
for all that, we should like the old lady's own account of how she came into existence, and
how she became such a power in the land, and what she does with all the money we lend her,
and out of what purse she pays us for the loan.

She certainly ought to be able to tell an interesting tale--for her palace, her servants, her
house-keeping, her treasures, her cellars, her expenditure, her receipts and clearing, the
frights she has every now and again both given and received, must each and all be more amusing
and full of interest than any fairy tale told by Grimm or Andersen.
