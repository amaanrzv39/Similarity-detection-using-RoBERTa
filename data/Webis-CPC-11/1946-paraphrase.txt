It is so important to God's people, that unless we are seperated from the pleasures of the flesh, they cannot bask in God's light for eternity; for the damage of earthly pleasure gets in the way of God's love, or so confuses man that his soul can not accept God's word as he must.  

This may appear hard, but it quite clear, what can we get out of this world but what is in this world?
