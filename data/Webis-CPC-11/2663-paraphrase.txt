I moved as fast as I could, travelling the 2 miles of highroad and another mile of woodland area.  I had all of this in front of me, along with the fast approaching evening sky.  Even though I had travelled about 30 miles at this point, my feet did not complain.  I continued on with head slightly hanging, deep in thought.

I reached a surprise curve on the way and lifted my head to analyze what was in front of me.  I could see, 50 yards ahead, that there was a dark, bewildered entity slightly moving.  The thought crossed my mind that this could be a gang of coolies from a nearby mine, possibly looking for necessities.  So, I cautiously moved forward 40 footsteps, came to a complete stop and remained, stuck in my stance as if glued.  The undefined thing in front of me began to take form.  It was definitely a humongous tiger.
