Whittlesey's book contains four hundred and eighty-seven pages. Of these he uses up seventy-six
before he gets a civilized man in what became Cuyahoga County, and fifty more before he gets
any actual settlers to the mouth of the Cuyahoga River. The history of the next thirteen or
fourteen years, down to the War of 1812, fills the mass of the book, details being here given
that really have historical value. The last forty pages are devoted to the history of the two
or three following decades.
