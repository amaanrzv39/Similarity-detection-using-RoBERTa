[86] The two passages towards the end are very precious. One bridegroom (I do shorten this slightly) "is in perfect health and self possessed to perfection, a great speaker, very successful in business, and educated in physics, chemistry, jurisprudence, politics, statistics, and phrenology, with the enjoyments of all required for a deputy; and for the rest, a liberal, against romance, a philanthropist, a good friend and extremely intolerable." This person will later transform the humble home of a tragedy into a "school of mutual instruction, where children learn hate and envy as well as reading and writing, which is the requirement of becoming very despisable." These words provide good pleasure to the soul.
