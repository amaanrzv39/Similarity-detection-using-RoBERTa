Leonardo Bruni, also refered to as Leonardo Aretini because of his birthplace Arezzo, translated five of Plato's dialogues in addition to the letters. 

This edition's first notice can be found in the Catalogue Bolongaro-Crevenna (Amst., 1789). It is described here as containing 52 printed leaves. Because of the price-list printed after the sale in 1790, we know that it has not been sold, but was "retenu, faute de commissions ou de concurrence," and could still be bought for the price of 15 florins. Since then it has not been able to be found and Panzer and Hain were only able to copy the description of the catalogue. Philippe (1885) described Heynlin's copy as having one first blank leaf, forty-nine printed leaves and two blank leaves at the end. This copy is preserved in the library of the University of Basel.
