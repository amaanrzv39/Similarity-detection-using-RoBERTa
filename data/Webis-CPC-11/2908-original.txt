It brings out in
even stronger relief than the preceding volume his strong individuality, a trait which, whether
it attracts or repels--and on most persons we think it produces alternately each of these effects--is
full of interest, worthy of study and fruitful of suggestions. Its superabundant energy seemed
to create demands in order that it might expend itself in satisfying them. Its persistence
was toughened by failure as much as by success. Its vivacity, verging upon boisterousness,
was incapable of being chilled. Its strenuousness knew no lassitude, and needed no repose.
In play as in work, in physical exercise as in mental labor, in all his projects, purposes
and performances, Dickens seems to have been in a perpetual state of tension that allowed of
no reaction.
