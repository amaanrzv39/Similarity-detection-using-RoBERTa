The number of
tradesmen, who must be all of respectable character, summoned to the first meeting, is always
greater than the number required to serve on the inquest, because many find it very inconvenient,
and others find it impossible, to give their services. Valid excuses are admitted in plea against
the performance of the duty; but a frivolous excuse is not allowed; and a tradesman, whose
turn it is to serve, if he can prefer no good reason for not serving, must serve or pay the
fine.
