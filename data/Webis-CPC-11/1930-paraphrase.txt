The most distubrbing aspect of the disease is that there was no real change.  The most distressing part is that it never changed.  And from that situation I just could never get away, except the few times I slept without dreams, that time of life when you are dead, though we never truly stop being ourselves.  There was no relief.  

I hated my reflections in the windows I passed, and yet my eyes were always drawn to them,  hoping that somehow the reflection would be different, even if it was worse.
