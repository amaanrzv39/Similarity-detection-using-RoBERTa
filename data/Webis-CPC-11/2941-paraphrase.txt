All of a sudden there is hastle movement on the ship. The guns are taken into action and all the sailors run through the deck holes into the ship.The commander comes at the last. The crew seals every leakege to prevent the water from gushing in.Only the  sea green colored  periscope,camouflaged in white is visible as the U-47-1/2 drowns. The watch officer sees through the periscope silently .

"She is a Dutchman,sir" said the officer.The commander peeps through the periscope. The Dutchman was heading towards a continental port as it had no wireless. Ultimately a wrong decision to attack every Dutch submarine because many German submarine have already committed this mistake leading to disaster.
