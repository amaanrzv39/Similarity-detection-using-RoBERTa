Goethe posed as someone at a local inn who had taken ill, and sent word to Stilling asking him to come.  Stilling did not recognize Goethe as he was in bed with his head covered.  Goethe requested that Stilling come close to feel his pulse, and at that moment flung his arms around Stilling's neck.  That very evening, a local merchant was hosting a gathering in honor of Lavater.
