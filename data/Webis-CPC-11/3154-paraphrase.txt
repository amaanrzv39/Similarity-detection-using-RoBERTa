A few tribes, including the Abirianos and the Maquiritares, live in the mountains. However, neighboring savannahs,* delineated by the Cassiquiare, the Atabapo, the Orinoco, and the Rio Negro, are completely devoid of human inhabitants. (* The rivers form a four-sided figure of a thousand square leagues, whose opposite sides are of opposite slopes. In the configuration, the Cassiquiare flows towards the south, the Atabapo towards the north, the Orinoco towards the northwest, and the Rio Negro towards the southeast.) In this area, crudely etched drawings of the sun, the moon, and different animals can be found on granite rocks, evidencing the prior presence of a people, not similar to those discovered to have lived on the banks of the Orinoco.
