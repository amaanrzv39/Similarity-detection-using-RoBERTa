Our ideas half emerge for a moment from the dim acreage of important feeling and diffused sense, and are hardly fixed before they are changed and transformed,by the shifting of attention and the of new relations,into ideas of really different objects. This fludity of the mind would make reflection impossible, did we not fix in words and other symbols certain abstract contents;we thus become capable of recognizing in one perception the repetition ofanother, and of recognizing in certain recurrences of impressions a persistent object. This discrimination and classification of the contents of consciousness is the work of perception and understanding, and the pleasures that accompany these activities make the beauty of the sensible world.


But our hold upon our thoughts extends even further. We not onl constructs visible unities and recognizable types,but remain aware of their affection to what is not at the time perceived;that is; we find in them a certain tendency and quality, not orignal to them, a meaning and a tone, which upon investigation we shall see to have been the proper charaecteristics of other objects and feelings.
The hushed impact of these associated feeling continue in the brain, and by modifying our present reaction,colour the image upon which our attention is fixed.The quality thus acquired by objects through association is what we call their expression
