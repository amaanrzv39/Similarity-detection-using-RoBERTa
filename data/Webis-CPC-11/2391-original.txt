One takes up a capital work on rural architecture, written perhaps ten or fifteen years ago,
before the general introduction of furnaces, steam pipes, gas, baths, marble basins, etc.;
they find a house that suits them, which the book says will cost $6,000, and that is just the
amount, by close figuring, that can be raised for building. The house is ordered, put in the
hands of the best mechanic to finish all complete, and he goes ahead; he is unrestricted except
by the book, and the author of it is a man of reputation.
