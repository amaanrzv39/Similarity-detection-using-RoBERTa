The spectra of all known elements, with the exception
of a few gaseous ones, or those too rare to be yet obtained, have been photographed in connection
with the solar spectrum, from the extreme ultra-violet down to the D line, and eye observations
have been made on many to the limit of the solar spectrum. A table of standard wave lengths
of the impurities in the carbon poles extending to wave length 2,000 has been constructed to
measure wave lengths beyond the limits of the solar spectrum.
