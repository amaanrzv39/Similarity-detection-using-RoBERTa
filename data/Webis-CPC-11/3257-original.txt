But that is a Point nothing to the Passage in Question;
which means, as I have shewn in another Place, That Sophocles declaimed in Prose, contending
to obtain a Chorus for reviving some Pieces of Thespis and Chœrilus. Is This contending against
Them, as rival Poets?

    [Footnote C: In Ranis, v. 73.]

    [Sidenote: Meursius, and Camerarius mistaken.]

IV. Some other Learned Men have likewise been mistaken in Particulars with regard to Sophocles.
In the Synopsis of his Life, we find these Words; Τελευτᾶ δὲ μετὰ Ἐυριπίδην ἐτῶν ϛ’. Meursius,
as well as Camerarius, have expounded This, as if Sophocles surviv’d Euripides six Years. But
the best Accounts agree that they died both in the same Year, a little before the Frogs of
Aristophanes was play’d; scil. Olymp. 93, 3. The Meaning, therefore, of the Passage is, as
some of the Commentators have rightly observ’d; That Sophocles died after Euripides, at 90
Years of Age. The Mistake arose from hence, that, in Numerals, ϛʹ signifies as well 6 as 90.

    [Sidenote: Father Brumoy mistaken.]

V. The Learned Father Brumoy too, who has lately given us three Volumes upon the Theatre of
the Greeks, has slipt into an Error about Sophocles; for, speaking of his Antigone, he tells
us, it was in such Request as to be perform’d Two and Thirty times; Elle fût representée trente
deux fois. The Account, on which This is grounded, we have from the Argument prefix’d to Antigone
by Aristophanes the Grammarian: and the Latin Translator of this Argument, probably, led Father
Brumoy into his Mistake, and he should have referr’d to the Original.
