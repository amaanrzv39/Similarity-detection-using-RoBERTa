Moreover, he repeatedly saw near him German stretcher
bearers firing on our wounded.

The soldier Dreyfus of the --th Infantry Regiment related the following story to Dr. Ferry:

"On the 10th of September at Somaine, as he was leaving the battlefield, wounded, he met three
Germans. He told them in German that he had just been wounded, but these men answered that
this was no reason why he should not receive another bullet, and they thereupon shot him point
blank in the eye."

At Vaubecourt an infantry sergeant and two soldiers were shot by the enemy. They alleged that
one of the latter was found on the church tower in the village, from which he would have been
able to exchange signals with our troops.

On the 22d of August a detachment of Germans arrived in the vicinity of Bouvillers in the Department
of Meurthe-et-Moselle at the farm of La Petite Rochelle, where the owner, M. Houillon, had
lodged some French wounded soldiers. The officer in command ordered four of his men to go and
finish off nine wounded who were lying in the barn. Each one was shot in the ear. Mme. Houillon
begged mercy for them, and the officer, placing the barrel of his revolver to her breast, told
her to be silent.

On the 25th of August the Abbé Denis, curé of Réméréville, tended in the evening Lieut. Toussaint,
who last July headed the list of candidates who left the School of Forestry. As he fell wounded
on the battlefield this young officer was struck with bayonets by all the Germans who passed
near him.
