One day as Mochuda was keeping his herd as usual beside the river already alluded to, he heard
the bishop and his clerics pass by, chanting psalms as they went along.  The Spirit of God
touched the boy's heart and leaving his pigs Mochuda followed the procession as far as the
monastery called Tuaim [Druim Fertain] [into which the clerics entered]. And as the bishop
and his household sate down to eat, Mochuda, unknown to them, concealed himself--sitting in
the shadow of the doorway. Meanwhile the king, Maoltuile, was troubled about the boy, noticing
his absence [from the homestead at Achaddi] that evening and not knowing the cause thereof.
He immediately sent messengers to seek the youth throughout the country, and one of these found
him sitting, as indicated, in the shadow of the doorway of the bishop's house.
