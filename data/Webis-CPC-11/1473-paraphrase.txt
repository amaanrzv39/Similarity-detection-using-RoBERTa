The existence of arcs between the granules never has been seen or otherwise observed under normal working conditions of a transmitter.
          When ares surely are experimentally established between the granules the usefulness of the transmitter ceases. The final theory, that change of pressure changes area & surface contacts does not explain. Why other conduct ores
than carbon are not good materials for transmitters.

            That it may be noticed, is just what
the theories set out to make clear.
