In less than a one 100, alongside telescopes, microscopes, micrographs and telephones, the Royal Society will have to offer a premium for such an etheroscope.

It is in addition needed in binding with the query under response that "An English F.T.S." should recognise that the "Adepts" of the Good Law refuse gravity as at present explained. They renounce that the so-called "impact theory" is the only one that is tenable in the gravitation hypothesis. They declare, that if all efforts made by the physicists to bind it with ether, in rank to clarify electrical and magnetic distance-action have hitherto confirmed whole disappointments, it is over due to the run ignorance of the greatest states of subject in Nature, and, foremost of all, of the actual natural world of the solar stuff.
