It happens with most couples that after marrige, the husbands work separates him from home, and the pressure is most on the wife. This is increased with his absence from home. Before marrige the wife would have led a much independent life but now the couple live in a small house, have 1 or 2 children and can only afford one helper, and sometimes couples cant even afford that. This results in the husbaand and wife constantly fighting with each other. its a wonder if she misses all the love and devotion that she had before marrige
