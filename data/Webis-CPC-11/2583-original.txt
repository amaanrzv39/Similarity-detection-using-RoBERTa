Broad,
manly views and hopeful thoughts of life exist less here, we think, than in England. The cities
are supplied year by year with people from the country; yet the latter, the source of all this
supply, does not produce so healthy mothers as the city; and were it not for the increasing
study of physiology and its vital truths, we fear that we should awaken too late to a knowledge
of our physical degeneration.

Now what means are in use among us to furnish the needed stimulant of exercise? It is paradoxical
to say that the average of people take more exercise in the city than in the country; yet we
believe it to be true. That exercise is only of one form, to be sure, namely, walking.
