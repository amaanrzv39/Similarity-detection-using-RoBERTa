He speaks no doubt that the long and painful their captivity, they have worked continuously for release, but not received before the end of seventy years complete. During which, on land which is land of Judah, which sometimes was blessed of God, but was given to be desecrated by bad people, I received no help, nor charged any release: for inhabitants of the world not decreased, that is, tyrants and oppressors of God's people were not taken, but stayed and continued blasphemers of God and of his church troublers.

But still, God!
