It was learnt, however, that a Boer picquet had been on the top, and had
galloped off on the approach of the infantry. Daylight found the column in possession of Elandskloof,
which was reached after a difficult climb by steep and circuitous paths. Shortly after daylight
several Boers were observed to be driving their cattle into kloofs above the Badfontein valley
for safety. An advance was made shortly afterwards towards Schwartz Kopjes, which place was
reached without much opposition towards dark. At Schwartz Kopjes camp was formed for the night,
the infantry entrenching themselves in the kopjes round the camp, with one company posted in
a farmhouse about 400 yards west of the main camp.

On the following day General Kitchener ordered the mounted troops and guns to make a reconnaissance
towards Dulstroom. Whilst the rest of the force remained in camp, the baggage under escort
was sent towards Belfast. The reconnoitring force fared badly, for after advancing a few miles
Boers in large numbers were seen collecting on the high hills due west, and approaching at
a rapid pace. The reconnoitring force was shortly afterwards heavily engaged, and compelled
to retire on to the camp.

The infantry were now ordered to retire as rapidly as possible to a ridge in rear, distant
about 2000 to 2500 yards. The cavalry retired hard pressed on to Schwartz Kopjes, which they
held until the infantry had completed their movement, when the cavalry again retired back to
the neighbourhood of the infantry.
