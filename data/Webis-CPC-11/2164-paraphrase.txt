The steam enters the finished space (which forms one-fourth of the circumference) across the slide-valve, S, presses against the pistons, d, and inflicts the wheel towards revolve within the direction of the arrows. The slide-valve is  finished via the affair of the external allocating mechanism, the piston traverses beyond the steam-outlet, A, and a novel piston otherwise arrives within play. Altogether, there are six of these pistons, each one working  within  an aperture within the rim, and kept pressed seemingly via   processes of a spiral spring.
