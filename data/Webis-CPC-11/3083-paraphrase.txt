He headed south, where about mid-month, he happened upon a man by the name of Frances Asbury near Dover Delaware.  A formal meeting was arranged whereby Coke brought up the concept of a Methodist Church sponsored university.  Unknown to Coke, Asbury had already been approached by John Dickens four years earlier with a similar appeal, a school similar to Wesley's school in Knightwood, England, and so Asbury submitted a request with that goal in mind, located in North Carolina.

At the Christmas Conference in Baltimore in 1784, Coke pitched the university idea again, and it was met with outstanding approval.  Along with this endeavor came the formal founding of the Methodist Church, as well as the maiden Methodist College, and the appointment of both Coke and Asbury as Bishops.
