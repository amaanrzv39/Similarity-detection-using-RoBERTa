Bits
of veritable Shakspearean gold, burnished star-bright, embossed in pewter! Diamonds set in
dirt! Sentences illuminated with words of power, suddenly rising and sinking, through a flare

"For the play itself," said Dryden insolently, "the author seems to have begun it with some
fire;" and here it is continued with much smoke. "The characters of Pandarus and Thersites
are promising enough;" here we shudder at their performance. Such a monstrous Pandarus would
have been blackballed at the Pimp. Thersites--Shakspeare's Thersites--for Homer's was another
Thersites quite--finely called by Coleridge, "the Caliban of demagogic life"--loses all individuality,
and is but a brutal buffoon grossly caricatured.
