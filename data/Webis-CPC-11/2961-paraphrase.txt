This is real observation, not just the appearance of the oral lesson--that often has no purpose and doesn't lead to natural activity or appreciation.

It's often hard to satisfy curiosity in animals.  In Nursery School, we've mentioned what's suitable.  Transition and junior school children might see more when they go on field trips.  Around this time, kids often want to learn more about wild animals, usually after reading about them in books.  For instance, they'll want to know more about the camel that brought Rebecca to Isaac.  Or about Mowgli's wolf parents.  Kay and Gerda's reindeer.  The fox that tried to eat the seven little kids.  The tiger in "Little Black Sambo."  Androcles and his lion.  Interest in these animals is often helped by pictures from those stories.
