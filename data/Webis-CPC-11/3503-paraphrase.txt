Scarlett has always struck me as a lucky woman, he said as he paced reslessly up and down the room. She loves him. She may marry him and ultimately change him. Is there any escape for him in this world and the next, provided that there is a next? Is there such a thing as justice? Perhaps he figures at this moment that the clearing of his conscience is a result of his offer to fight. After all, if he wants to marry her, he will. There would be nothing I could do about it. He knows I can't touch him, or sue for a divorce in fear of causing a scandal. He has me, so he figures. Perhaps he is right. But if he thinks I am completely helpless, he is surely mistaken. I might as well visit London and see if he is still up and around tomorrow night. It is merely formal but I'll go. I should've known she would attempt to smear her name, as well as the boys, if she could. She will win, unless I exercise caution. Oh Lord, how did I marry a foolish woman who regards not even her own interests. If I could go back in time and change things, a Becky Sharp would be my wife  or any other she devil. I wish she showed more intelligence.
