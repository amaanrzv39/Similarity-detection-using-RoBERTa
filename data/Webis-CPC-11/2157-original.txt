One day the Master of Life took two pieces of clay and moulded them into two large feet, like
those of a panther. He did not make four--there were two only.

He put his own feet into them, and found the tread very light and springy, so that he might
go with great speed and yet make no noise.

Next he built up a pair of very tall legs, in the shape of his own, and made them walk about
a while. He was pleased with the motion. Then followed a round body covered with large scales,
like those of the alligator.
