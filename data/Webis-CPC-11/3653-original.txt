He invites the German
people to enter into a union with the other peoples. In the tone of an inspired evangelist,
he reminds the German people of its true destiny, its spiritual mission, a thousandfold more
important than any empty victory. To all the peoples of Europe, he points out the duty of the
hour, the pressing task: to achieve the unity of Europe and the organisation of the world.

"Come, then, kindred spirits!... I am a free man, freed from everything in the world, free
from the state [staatenlos], ein deutscher Weltbürger [a German citizen of the world].... I
have peace! [Ich habe Frieden].... Come! Cry aloud what you already know and feel!... We do
not wish to make peace; we simply wish to realise that we have peace...."

Reiterating his cry of October, 1914, the Call to Europeans[90] which he, in conjunction with
his friends Albert Einstein, Wilhelm Foerster, and Otto Buek, issued as a counterblast to the
insane utterances of the 93, he reaffirms his act of faith in the spirit of Europe, one and
brotherly; and he launches his appeal to all the free spirits, to those whom Goethe long ago
termed: "Good Europeans."

OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT WILSON

MONSIEUR LE PRÉSIDENT,

The peoples are breaking their chains. The hour foreseen by you and desired by you is at hand.
May it not come in vain! From one end of Europe to the other, there is rising among the peoples
the will to resume control of their destinies, and to unite, that they may form a regenerated
Europe. Across the frontiers, they are holding out their hands to one another for a friendly
clasp. But between them there still remain abysses of mistrust and misunderstanding. These
abysses must be bridged.
