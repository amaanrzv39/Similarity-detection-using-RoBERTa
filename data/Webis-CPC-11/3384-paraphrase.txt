Luther had a dream of restoring religion to its primitive purity, which has come to but a poor realization at the hands of his "followers."  This leads one to assume that if the martyrs of the Reformation came back and saw the fruits of their martyrdom, suffered that pure religion might live, they would conclude that they might as well have saved themselves the trouble for the little resulting good that was accomplished.

Pronounced phimosis the aperture in the prepuce may not be in a line with the meatus, resulting in discharge of urine or the ejaculations of seminal fluid.  This could lead to an inability to find an egress. The escaping urethral fluid could, as in the case where the opening is at the side or upper part of the prepuce, cause it to bloat until a sufficient quantity is thrown out as to cause swelling. In such cases, impotency is as likely as when seminal fluid is forced backward into the bladder.  Generally speaking, phimosis may affect the shape of a man's reproductive organ, which may have devastating repercussions for his domestic relations or his ability to father a child.  We should also consider diseases and conditions that can be triggered by phimosis or can be caused by a man becoming more susceptible to it from phimosis. It is important to make note that sexual relations are more important to man and woman than is generally acknowledged or admitted. We continue to wait for the days of the establishment of the Utopian republic of Plato. Truly platonic love, which has existed in the past and will once again exist in the future, does not now exist in its true form.
