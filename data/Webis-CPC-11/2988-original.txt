Résumé of the laws of value of each of the three classes of commodities.

A general résumé of the laws of value, where a free movement of labor and capital exists, may
now be briefly made in the following form:

Exchange value has three conditions, viz.: 1. Utility, or ability to satisfy a desire (U).
2. Difficulty of attainment (D), according to which there are three classes of commodities.
3. Transferableness.

Of the second condition, there are three classes: 1. Those limited in supply—e.g., ancient
pictures or monopolized articles. 2. Those whose supply is capable of indefinite increase by
the use of labor and capital. 3. Those whose supply is gained at a gradually increasing cost,
under the law of diminishing returns.
