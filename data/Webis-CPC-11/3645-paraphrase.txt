5125--Petitions, 1793-7)

     On the principle advanced by Rochefoucault, that there is something not displeasing to us in the misfortunes of our friends, the sailor doubtless derived a sort of negative satisfaction from the fact that he was not the only one on shipboard liable to the pains and penalities of irascibility,brutality and excessive disciplinary zeal. Particularly was this true of his special friend the "sky-piolr' or chaplain, that super person who poerhaps most often fell a victim to quarter deck ebulitions. Notably there is on record the case of one John Cruickshank, chaplain of H.M.S.Assurance, who was clapped in irons, court-martialled and dismissed the service merely because he happend to take-what no sailor could ever condemn him for-a drop too much, and whilst in that condition insisted on preaching to the ship's company when they were on the very point of going into action. His zeal was unsual. Most naval chaplains thought "of nothing more than making His Majesty's ships sinecures") There is also that other case of the "saucy Surgeon of the Seahorse" who incurred his captian's dire displeasure all on account  of candles, of which necessary articles he, having his wife on board, thought himself entitled to a more liberal share than was consistent with strict naval economy; and who was, moreover, so "troublesome about his Provisions, that if he did not always Chuse out of ye best in ye whole Ship". he straightway got his back up and "threatend to Murder the Steward."
