In the outer part of the sad- looking cave was a woman who lay in her usual position and place. She was the chief warrior's daughter-in -law. Rumours had it that she had been taken to the woods, supposedly to "the white men" to be treated with their 'medicine'. The chief, was to be sure, against such speculations. He was heavily burdened by the present circumstance of seeing his sick daughter-in-law and having the attention of the other warriors on him. To divert their attention, he went to the bedside and bent down to look at his daughter-in-law. To his shock and disbelief, he discovered that she was dead.

The chief was overcome by his sorrow about the death and tried to hide his tears. Upon recovering his composure, he faced the other warriors and said in his local dialect, while pointing to his dead daughter-in-law,-
"My son's wife is dead! The Great Spirit is furious."

Everyone was silent and in mourning when they heard this. After a while, one elder Indian prepared to speak. Before he could do so, a black thing rolled out of a place nearby- and joining the cave- to the middle, among them.
