The Menorah movement is welcome as a proof of a new order in the life of the young college
Jew. He has come to see at last that it is comic, in large part, to be shut out from the Greek
letter fraternities of the Hellenes and the Barbarians, but that it is tragic, in large part,
to shut himself out from the life of his own people. For it is from his own people that he
must draw his vision and spiritual sustenance if he is to live a life of self-mastery rather
than the life of a contemptible parasite rooted nowhere and chameleonizing everywhere. Time
was when their fellow-Jews half excused the college men, who drifted away from the life of
Israel, as if the burden of the Jewish bond were too much for the untried and unrobust shoulders
of our Jewish college men, as if their intellectual and moral squeamishness led to inevitable
revolt against association with their much-despised and wholly misunderstood Jewish fellows.
Now we see, and our younger brothers of the Menorah fellowship have caught the vision, that
no Jew can be truly cultured who Jewishly uproots himself, that the man who rejects the birthright
of inheritance of the traditions of the earliest and virilest of the cultured peoples of earth
is impoverishing his very being. The Jew who is a "little Jew" is less of a man.

The Menorah lights the path for the fellowship of young Israel, finely self-reverencing. Long
be that rekindled light undimmed!
