The castings may be removed from the mould by slightly heating the latter, but many breakages
result.  Insulators made on this plan are much less affected by the condensation of moisture
from the air than anything except fused quartz.  They are, however, very weak mechanically,
and apt to crack by exposure to such changes of temperature as go on from day to day.  It is
clear, however, that in spite of this their magnificent electrical properties fit them for
many important uses.
