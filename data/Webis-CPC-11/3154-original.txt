Some independent tribes, the Abirianos and the Maquiritares,
dwell in the mountainous country; but in the neighbouring savannahs,* bounded by the Cassiquiare,
the Atabapo, the Orinoco, and the Rio Negro, there is now scarcely any trace of a human habitation.
(* They form a quadrilateral plot of a thousand square leagues, the opposite sides of which
have contrary slopes, the Cassiquiare flowing towards the south, the Atabapo towards the north,
the Orinoco towards the north-west, and the Rio Negro towards the south-east.) I say now; for
here, as in other parts of Guiana, rude figures representing the sun, the moon, and different
animals, traced on the hardest rocks of granite, attest the anterior existence of a people,
very different from those who became known to us on the banks of the Orinoco.
