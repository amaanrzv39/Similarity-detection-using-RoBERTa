Intellectual application will, to some extent, overcome physical difficulties. By working at
least five hours a day, and by reading the Cricket Field daily and nightly, I did learn to
bowl a little, with a kind of twist. This, while it lasted, in a bowlerless country, was a
delightful accomplishment. You got into much better sporting society than you deserved, and,
in remote parts of the pastoral districts you were looked up to as one whose name had been
in Bell's Life; we still had Bell's Life then.
