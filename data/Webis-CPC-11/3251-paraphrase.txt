Their opinion is wrong, who believe that all mouths profit in a country that consumes its produce, and can be truly said, that kind who does not serve the Commonwealth, either by being employed or employing others is not only unnecessary, but an offensive in this State.

As a charity, and what really owe it to human nature, to provide for the elderly, lame, sick, blind, and impotent, so it is not justice we owe to the Commonwealth to suffer, such as would be health, and may continue, to be drones and live on the work of others.

Most, such as are a burden to the public is cottagers and paupers, beggars in big cities and towns, and vagrants.

In a survey of books fireplace, made in Michaelmas, 1685, found that 1.3 million households in the whole kingdom, that of a stack amounted to 554,631, but some of these lands have about them, all our calculations, we have calculated the cottagers, but 500,000 families, but among them, many can earn their livelihood, and no charge for the parish, which is why Mr. King very wisely calculates his cottagers and paupers, decreasing the wealth of the nation but least 400,000 families, in which he includes the account of poor houses in cities, towns and villages, to which he believes 30,000 homeless, and all these together to make up 1.33 million head.

This is a very large proportion of people are a burden on the other hand, is weighing the interests of land, of which landed gentlemen certainly be very sensitive.
