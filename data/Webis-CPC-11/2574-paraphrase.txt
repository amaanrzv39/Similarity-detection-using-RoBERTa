The following is a brief explanation of the notation used for classification purposes.  The title of a notable and timely work will be preceded by three asterisks.  These works may be found on the annual "Rolls of Honor".  An asterisk before the author's name signifies a foreign author.  After the author's name is a cross reference to earlier series volumes.  An (H) after the author's name means that this author has other stories published in American magazines between 1900-1914.  These stories are listed in "The Standard Index of Short Stories".  In parentheses you will find the volume and page number of the magazine.  This index was compiled by Francis J. Hannigan in 1918 and published by Small, Maynard & Company.
