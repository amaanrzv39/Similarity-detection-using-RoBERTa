Seeing me, a set and gloomy expression, most unsuitable to a bridegroom,
changed to a look of actual fury. If I had been a small tame dog which had unexpectedly sprung
up to bite him, he could not have glared more venomously.

Since he had come to London we had met almost every day, and when necessary I had been as dully
polite as a book on etiquette. But only when necessary. At other times I had effaced myself;
now, though I was keen for news of Di, I didn't care to get it from him, especially after that
look.
