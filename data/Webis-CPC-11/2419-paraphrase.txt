Mallarmé's unique style of thinking set his writing apart from that of others in a way that many find difficult to understand (if they recognise it in the first place). Rather than clarifying the relationshisps between concepts in his work, he left it up to the reader to make the necessary connections in order to reach the conclusions he wished to emphasise. Mallarmé felt little need to appeal to the wider literary community: he made no novel strides with his work, nor did he concern himself with making his work easily accessible to others.
