It was my task to catch that horse within that couple of hundred yards.At least he let me come near him to catch hold of him,but he was stubbornly hard to deal with him.It was high time not to do such a mad chase,I never thought of doing so and indeed the more it lasted the more I becamestubbornly hard to deal with it.I chased the beast,he let me come close to him and ran suddenly withhigh pitched cry.It was very annoying which made me more fierce and violent.It was deliberately hurtful with hidden feeling of joy as if the animal knew that he was making fool of me with triumphant feeling.At last I became exhausted with my horse hunt and decided to give a last try and if that failed then give it off.
