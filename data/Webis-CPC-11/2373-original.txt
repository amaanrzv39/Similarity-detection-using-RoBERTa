Punch to the Prophet.

  Prophet of o'er-population, your ingenious calculation,
  Causeth discombobulation only in the anxious mind
  That forecasts exhausted fuel, or the period when the duel
  Will have given their final gruel to French journalists; a kind
  Of cantankerous, rancorous spitfires, blusterous, braggart, boyish, blind,
    Who much mourning scarce would find.
