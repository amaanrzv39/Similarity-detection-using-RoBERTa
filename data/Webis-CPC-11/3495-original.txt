Nevertheless, it seems to have been successful,
for the author some time afterwards, speaking of the town's former discouragement of her dramas,
remarks that "the taste is mended." Later in 1701 she brought out at Drury Lane her only comedy,
Love at a Loss, dedicated in most enthusiastic terms to Lady Piers, to whom "I owe the greatest
Blessing of my Fate," the privilege of a share in her friendship. Love at a Loss was made up
of the comic scenes introduced into an old tragedy which the author had failed to get acted.
This is not a fortunate method of construction, and the town showed no favour to Love at a
Loss. The first and only public section of Catharine Trotter's career was now over, and she
withdrew, a wayworn veteran at the age of twenty-two, to more elevated studies.

When Love at a Loss was published the author had already left town, and after a visit to Lady
Piers in Kent she now settled at Salisbury, at the house of a physician, Dr. Inglis, who had
married her only sister. Her growing intimacy with the family of Bishop Burnet may have had
something to do with her determination to make this city her home. She formed a very enthusiastic
friendship with the Bishop's second lady, who was an active theologian and a very intelligent
woman. Our poetess was fascinated by Mrs. Burnet. "I have not met," she writes in 1701, "such
perfection in any of our sex." She now visited in the best Wiltshire society. When the famous
singer, John Abell, was in Salisbury, he gave a concert at the palace, and Catharine Trotter
was so enchanted that she rode out after him six miles to Tisbury to hear him sing again at
Lord Arundell of Wardour's house. She had a great appreciation of the Bishop's "volatile activity."
