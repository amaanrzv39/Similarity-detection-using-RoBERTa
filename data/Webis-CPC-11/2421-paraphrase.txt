After sintering, these were "pasted", as described previously. These methods produced very fragile filaments, but they were more efficient than the previous ones. Ductile tungsten was replaced in this country shortly. An ingot of tungsten is subjected to vigorous swaging until it takes the form of a rod. The rod is then drawn into wire.

This product was developed largelly by the laboratories of the General Electric Company, in one of many great improvements they contribued to.
