His mother, who had always been of poor health, had become very sick with no hope of recovering. This made her extremely worried, not for herself but at the thought of what would happen to her little boy after she passed away. The situation was putting a lot of stress on her faith in God. But through long prayers, peace returned to her soul and her faith in God strengthened. Before she died, she became peaceful and content that though she herself would not be around for her son, she was leaving him in the care of the Almighty God who would surely look after him very well. After all, it is He who takes care of orphans and widows alike.
