George the Third.

His late majesty was very partial to Mr. Carbonel, the wine-merchant, and frequently admitted
him to the royal hunts. Returning from the chase one day, the king entered affably into conversation

heartily at the whimsical apology.

The Duke of Wellington.

A certain noble lord, who was the duke's aide-de-camp, visited his grace early on the morning
of the battle of Salamanca, and perceiving him lying on a very small camp bedstead, observed,
"that his grace had not room to turn himself;" who immediately, in his usual characteristic
manner, rejoined, "When you have lived as long and seen so much as I have, you will know, that
when a general thinks of turning in his bed, it is full time to turn out."
