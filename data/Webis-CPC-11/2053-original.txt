When the scene shifts to Boston, the language, which was in perfect keeping with the tropical
madness of Antony's flight and the tropical splendor of the Southern forest, is extravagant
to actual absurdity, when used with reference to ordinary scenes and ordinary events. All the
force of contrast is lost; and contrast is the great secret of effect. The lavish richness
of our author's words is as little suited to the things they describe as a mantle of gold brocade
would be to the shoulders of a beggar.
