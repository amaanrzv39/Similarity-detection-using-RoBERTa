Reverend Richard Midgley, Vicar of Rochdale (Vol. vii., p. 380).--The collection of the lives
of pious persons to which Dr. Whitaker refers, as containing a very interesting account of
Midgley, will undoubtedly be Samuel Clarke's Lives of Thirty-two English Divines. The passage,
which will scarcely be new to your correspondent, is at p. 68. of the life of "Master Richard
Rothwell" (Clarkes's Lives, edit. 1677, fol.), and a very pleasing passage it is, and one that
I might almost {439} be justified in extracting.
