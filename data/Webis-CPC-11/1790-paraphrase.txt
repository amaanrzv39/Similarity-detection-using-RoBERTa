The following day we fished upwards of 3 sharks that are similar in size. Then we ate our good catch boiled and pressed and stewed with vinegar and pepper. We ran with the estern wind to the southwardwind from a latitude of 20 degrees 00 minutes to 29 degrees 5 minutes south, and having then 7 degrees 3 minutes east longitude  realizing we went east
