Miss Wan must not be harshly treated. Having married into my family, I accept her as if she were kin and will not abide anything but utter respect being paid to her person. In truth, to appear so youthful, as she must, imposes a great burden upon a lady.

Lady Smirk: Never the less, she does remain decidedly attractive. And, given her habit of reading with naught but a candle for light, her weakened eyesight is only to be expected.

Mrs. Able: Agreed. And furthermore, I do declare, she does conducts herself with a most stately grace. As we all know, she was raised in a...common household. Mother a miller. Father a baker of sorts...sugar I believe, in Bristol. Yet, to see her now, one would hardly guess at her lowly begins.

Sir Jem: I admit, the two of you are far to kind.

Sir Chris: More than too kind. They are alarmingly so.
