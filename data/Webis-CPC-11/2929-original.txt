The millions of ignorant colored people in our own country not yet reached need to be saved.
They cannot save themselves. We owe them the Christianity which we have. We owe them a chance
for intelligent faith. More than forty per cent. of nearly eight millions are yet in density
of ignorance and mentally and morally weak. They can be saved. What has been done is the pledge
of what may be done. Let us then consecrate ourselves anew to the victories of peace and make
our thank offerings free and large for the glory which comes not of sieges and battles, but
the glory of Christian love and faith, of Christian thinking and Christian working, for God's
poor people who wait for their day of redemption.

SHALL CUBA BE TAKEN FOR CHRIST?
