This fact largely accounts for the extreme importance attached
by them to marriage alliances, particularly those between members of royal houses.[16] These
unions gave to the princess the office of mediatrix; in Beowulf she is called Freothowebbe,
"the peace-weaver."[17] From this rose the high position held by queens. Their signatures appear
in acts of foundation, decrees of councils, charters, etc. Sometimes they reigned with full
royal authority, as did Seaxburg, Queen of the West Saxons, after the death of her husband.[18]
From the beginning of Christianity in England, the women, and particularly these royal women,
were as active and persevering in furthering the Faith, as their men.
