We anticipated the arrival of a certain ship, the Korea.  Once on board, it was my intention to speak with a Chinese woman.  She had a small girl with her named Kum Ping.  The woman was aware of our mission, in that she had been forewarned as how much information to offer especially to the foreign missionaries.  Her hesitant answers attested to this.  We knew she held our warnings about the evils of Chinatown with disregard because she commented, "I am a married woman, my husband will take care of me".  Our interpreter kept the conversation going, and soon had the woman smiling, then she offered to share some of her roast duck.
