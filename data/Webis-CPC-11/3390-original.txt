He was weak in cavalry, however, and could only meet Wheeler's
corps with a single division under Brigadier-General Sanders. Burnside had secured Sanders's
promotion from Mr. Stanton when the Secretary was at Louisville in October, in recognition
of the ability and gallantry shown in the expedition to East Tennessee in June and his other
services during the campaign. By giving Shackelford charge of the cavalry operating in the
upper valley and putting Sanders in command of those resisting Wheeler, Burnside was sure of
vigor and courage in the leadership of both divisions. Longstreet kept Wheeler on the left
bank of the Holston, directing him to overwhelm Sanders and move directly opposite Knoxville,
taking the city by a surprise if possible. But Sanders opposed a stubborn resistance, falling
back deliberately, and held the hills south of Knoxville near the river. Wheeler was thus baffled,
and returned to Longstreet on the 17th of November. The absence of his cavalry had been a mistake,
as it turned out; for the Confederate infantry, after crossing at Loudon to the right bank,
had not been able to push Burnside back as fast as Bragg's plans required, nor had they succeeded
at all in getting in the rear of the National forces.

As soon as it was definitely known at Knoxville that Longstreet was over the Holston, Burnside
went to the front at Lenoir's to take command in person. [Footnote: Burnside's Report, Official
Records, vol. xxxi. pt. i. p. 273.] He left General Parke as chief of staff in general charge
of affairs at headquarters, with Captain Poe in charge of the engineer work of preparing lines
of defence connecting the forts already planned and partly constructed.
