"Glad you have come," he said, as he stretched out his hand and gave me a vigorous grasp. His voice was rather high-keyed, issuing from so giant a form, but a pleasing timbre. 

While we were still standing up facing one another his remark was " I think I must have seen you before." His second remark was "It was some time in the early fifties on a railway train from Frankfort to Berlin. There was a pictorial paper in which I thought the man across from me was in. I thought that man was you."

This could not be, I replied, since at that period I was not in Germany. Impudently I added, "Besides, would you not have had me arrested as a malefactor?" 

With a good, natural laugh he exclaimed, "Oh, you mistake me. I never would have done that. On account of the Kinkel affair you mean? Oh, no! I liked that. If not that, it would be improper for His Majesty's minister and Chancellor of the North German Confederacy, I want to go to Spandau with you and have you tell me the entire story. Lets sit down."

He pointed at a easy-chair next to him to sit in and opened a bottle which stood, with two glasses, near his elbow on a tray. He said, "You are a Rhinelander. I know you will relish this." We touched our glasses together and the wine was very excellent. 

He continued with, "You smoke, of course, and here are some great Havanas."
