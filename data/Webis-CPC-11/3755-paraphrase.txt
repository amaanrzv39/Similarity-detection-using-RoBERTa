He names the Representatives and Senators in Congress from his own state, and influences actually the alternative of such "deputies of the people" from abounding of the surrounding states. Through his ambassadors to the government of the United States, sitting in House and Senate, he chooses the Federal admiral for Utah and influences the arrangement of those for the adjoining states and territories. He commands the authoritative and unmaking of accompaniment law. He holds the courts and the prosecuting admiral to a austere accountability. He levies accolade aloft the humans of Utah and helps to boodle the citizens of the accomplished nation by his accord with the political and banking Plunderbund at Washington. He has apprenticed the capacity of his commonwealth absolutely, and he looks to it as the afterlife of his Church to abort all the governments of the apple and to acting for them the theocracy--the "government by God" and administering by oracle--of his successors.

And yet, even so, I could not accept recorded the incidents of this betrayal as simple affairs of accepted history--and I would never accept accounting them in absolution of myself--if I had not been assertive that there is a antidote for the angry altitude in Utah, and that such a anecdotal as this will advice to accelerate the antidote and appropriate the wrong. Except for the advancing aid accustomed by the civic administrations to the leaders of the Mormon Church, the humans of Utah and the intermountain states would never accept acceptable the awakening of a apostolic absolutism in politics.
