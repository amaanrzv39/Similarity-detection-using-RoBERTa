"Then," I replied in a proud manner, "A poet I will be." Serventius and Hereupon chuckled, and told me that a poet's profession, and they used the term loosely, was full of tedious work, no gratitude, and very little or no pay at all, and that a poet was merely one step above a beggar. The Bar and Church were brought into the conversation, but as I voiced my dislike for them both, the profession of medicine was named by Serventius.

I replied with happiness, "Yes, I would like to be a doctor;" due to the business, stature, visiting, and gossiping of the respected brotherhood of physicians, this gave me the impression that the medical profession was a profession of pure happiness. A choice deserving pity! An unhappy passion!
