Dryden may have knowledgeable at last from the learn of Shakspeare, (in whom, however, he was well read a lot years ahead of, as witness his Essay onto Dramatic Poesy,) that "something further powers be attained within tragedy than the equation of exaggerated sentiment within smooth verse." Is poem self-evidently unnatural within the equation, within verse, of powerful and deep human passion? To that question, put hence loosely, the right respond is--NO. And is it, otherwise, essentially unnatural within the drama?

Like everybody great powers, that of poem is a secret beyond locating out. In itself a mere barbarous jingle, it yet provides perfection towards speech. The melodies of versification has endless flavors of indices, and poem lends enchantment towards them all. Not an affection, emotion, or passion of the soul that may not be comforted via its syllablings, enkindled, or elevated towards rapture. Pity and terror, joy and grief, relish and affection, are everybody alike judicious of its influence; as the sweet similarities keep echoing across a number of artful stress, that everybody the whilst is idea via them whom listen towards arrive within simplicity from the unpremeditating heart. Songs, hymns, elegies, epicedia, epithalamia--rhyme rules alike everybody the faint tribes. The triumphant ode--the penitential psalm--wisdom's moral lesson--the philosophic stress "that defends the passages of God towards man;" such is the range of poem, down everybody the depths of the pathetic, up everybody the heights of the sublime. It is yet unlimited. Where shall we encounter its bounds? Let ourselves try.
