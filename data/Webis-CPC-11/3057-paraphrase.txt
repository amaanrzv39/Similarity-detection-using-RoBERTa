With regard to the name Mona, applied both to Man and Anglesea, I have small doubt they may find its root in the Sanscrit man, to know, worship, &c., whence they have Manu the son of Brahma, Menu, Menes, Minos, Moonshee, and Monk. The name Mona would seem to have been applied to both islands, as being specially the habitation of the Druids, whose name probably came either from the Celtic Trow-wys, wisemen, or the Saxon dru, a soothsayer, very close in signification to the Sanscrit mooni, a holy sage, learned person. As connected with this idea I may ground another Query: Might not these four Monas, the abode of piety and wisdom, be the true, [Greek: makarôn nêsoi], the Fortunatæ Insulæ of the ancients?
