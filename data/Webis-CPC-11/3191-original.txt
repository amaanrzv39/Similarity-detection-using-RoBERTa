Crows.--To see a crow flying alone is a token of bad luck. An odd one, perched in the path
of the observer, is a sign of wrath.

Owls.--The ominous screech of this, the most ominous of all birds, is still heard with alarm;
and he remains with us, as in Chaucer's days,

  "The oule eke that of deth the bode bringeth."

When, as sometimes happens, he exchanges the darkness of his ivy bush for the rays of the sun
at noon-day, his presence is looked upon as indicative of bad luck to the beholder. Hence it
not infrequently happens that a mortal is as much scared by one of these occasional flights
as the small bird denizens of the tree on which he may happen to alight.

Cuckoos.--When the cry of the cuckoo is heard for the first time in the season, it is customary
to turn the money in the pocket, and wish.
