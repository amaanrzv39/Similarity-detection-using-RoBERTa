It is to be noted that applying two coats of the following: red lead, white zinc paint, plaster of Paris mixed with coal tar, kerosene oil, tallow mixed with rosin, tallow mixed with fish oil and applied while hot, verdigris, hydraulic cement mixed with coal tar, carbolic acid, Davis' insulating compound patent, carbolized compressed paper, tht Thilmany process, anti-fouling paint, and "vulcanized fiberz," have all proven to be great failures.

The only results that are able to be favored are that oak piles which were cut in January and with the bark on driven have resisted four to five years, or merely until the bark chipped, or fell off, and that well charred cypress piles resisted for up to nine years.
