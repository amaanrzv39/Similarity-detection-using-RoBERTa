The koilon is to us non-manifestation, because they have not unfolded powers which enable us to cognise it, & it may be the manifestation of a loftier order of LOGOI, utterly beyond our ken.
As none of our investigators can raise his consciousness to the highest plane of our universe, the Ã¢di-tattva plane, it may be of interest to describe how it is possible for them to see what may probably be the atom of that plane. That this may be understood it is essential to recall that the power of magnification by means of which these experiments are conducted is apart from the faculty of functioning on one or other of the planes. The latter is the result of a slow & gradual unfoldment of the Self, while the former is merely a special development of one of the plenty of powers latent in man.
