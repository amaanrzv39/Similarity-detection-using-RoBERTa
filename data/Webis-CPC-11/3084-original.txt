He thence traveled southward and, on
the 15th of the same month, met Francis Asbury at Dover, Delaware. At this first meeting, Coke
suggested the founding of an institution for higher education, to be under the patronage of
the Methodist Church.[25] This was not a new idea to Asbury; for, four years previous to this
meeting, John Dickins had made the same suggestion to him. The earlier idea had contemplated
only a school, on the plan of Wesley's at Knightwood, England, and for that purpose, a subscription
had been opened in North Carolina in 1781.[26]

Coke's suggestion, to have a college, was favorably received and, at the famous Christmas Conference
at Baltimore in 1784, the Church was formally organized, with Coke and Asbury as Bishops, and
the first Methodist College was founded.
