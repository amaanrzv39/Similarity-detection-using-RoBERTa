The desire of beauty, the love
of love, can but be a form of martyrdom when, as with Rossetti, there is also the desire of
possession.

Circumstances have very little to do with the making of a poet's temperament or vision, and
it would be enough to point to Christina Rossetti, who was hardly more in the country than
her brother, but to whom a blade of grass was enough to summon the whole country about her,
and whose poetry is full of the sense of growing things.
