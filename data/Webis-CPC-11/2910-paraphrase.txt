Occurring simultaneously to our battle with the First Corps of Meade's army, the other two forces of Rhodes and Early were pushing the Eleventh Corps on top of them.  I don't want to comment on the successes of the group but just present the facts--what I saw and was a part of.  

At the end of the fight, I stood towards the back of the line with a few other men, two who were shot and killed.  Even though we couldn't see the Red Coats, there were some snipers hiding in a building off to the side who got them.
