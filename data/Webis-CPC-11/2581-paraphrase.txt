Lengthen and separate the forefingers and thumbs, almost close all the other fingers and put the hands with backs out above and almost in front of the ears, about four inches away from the head and shake them back and forth a few times. Antelope's horns. Arapaho sign. (Dakota I, II, IV.)

Close your right hand with your end of the index forming a hook and the thumb extended like Fig. 234 shows; then wave the hand back and forth quickly, close to the temple (HidatsaI; ArikataI.) This resembles the pronged horn on the species. This sign is commonly used, but we noticed the latter sign while talking with one of the Dakotas (Dakota VI). That sign was used several times to be more undestood."
