December 25, 1858, was her last birthday.
She assembled a few old friends at dinner, and did the honors with all the brilliancy of her
brightest days. She told a variety of anecdotes with infinite drollery, and after dinner sang

    The boys they all paid him a visit.

It was a custom in Ireland to "wake" a man who was to be hung, the night before the execution,
so that the poor fellow might enjoy the whiskey drunk in his honor.
