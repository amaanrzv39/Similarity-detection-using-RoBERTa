These angry chiefs are on the point of separating, and terminating their
alliance, when the queen-mother Isabeau enters, and reconciles them. But when Isabeau, who,
from her unnatural hatred to her son Charles, and a certain coarseness of temper, is altogether
a very disagreeable personage, offers, woman against woman, to lead her own party against Johanna,
they all unite in bidding her return forthwith to Paris. The army, they say, is dispirited
when it thinks it fights for her cause--the cause of the mother against the son. Isabeau says:--

     "Ye know not, weak souls, that ye are the rights
     Of a wrong'd mother. I, for my part, love
     Who honours me; who injures me, I hate;
     And should this be my own begotten son,
     He is for this more hateful.
