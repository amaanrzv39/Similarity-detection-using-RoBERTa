We are enjoined to
  fear the Eternal Being and the King, and not to
  confederate with those who are given to change (Proverbs
  xxiv., v. 21). The prophets, in speaking of a
  non-Israelite ruler, say: 'Serve the King of Babylon, and
  ye shall live;' and they also command us to 'seek the
  peace of the city whither the Almighty has caused us to be
  carried away captives, and pray unto the Lord for it'
  (Jer. xxix., v. 7). The reverence we are enjoined to
  testify towards our earthly sovereign is further shown in
  our glorifying the Almighty Power for conferring a
  similitude of His boundless Majesty upon a mortal. We are
  enjoined not to swear against the King even in thought
  (Kohelit ch. x., v. 20), and to regard the decrees of the
  Monarch as inviolable ('Tract Baba Kama,' p. 112).
