Shakespeare and Homer may live long, but they will die some day, that is to say, they will
become unknown as direct and efficient causes. Even so God himself dies, for to die is to change
and to change is to die to what has gone before.  If the units change the total must do so also.

As no one can say which egg or seed shall come to visible life and in its turn leave issue,
so no one can say which of the millions of now visible lives shall enter into the afterlife
on death, and which have but so little life as practically not to count.  For most seeds end
as seeds or as food for some alien being, and so with lives, by far the greater number are
sterile, except in so far as they can be devoured as the food of some stronger life.  The Handels
and Shakespeares are the few seeds that grow--and even these die.

And the same uncertainty attaches to posthumous life as to pre- lethal.  As no one can say
how long another shall live, so no one can say how long or how short a time a reputation shall
live.  The most unpromising weakly-looking creatures sometimes live to ninety while strong
robust men are carried off in their prime.  And no one can say what a man shall enter into
life for having done.  Roughly, there is a sort of moral government whereby those who have
done the best work live most enduringly, but it is subject to such exceptions that no one can
say whether or no there shall not be an exception in his own case either in his favour or against
him.

In this uncertainty a young writer had better act as though he had a reasonable chance of living,
not perhaps very long, but still some little while after his death.  Let him leave his notes
fairly full and fairly tidy in all respects, without spending too much time about them.
