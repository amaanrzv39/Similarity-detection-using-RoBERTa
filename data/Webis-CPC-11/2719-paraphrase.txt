In the skull of the more enhanced and civilized territories amid the woolly-haired blacks of Africa, there is comparatively small deviation from the configuration which may be looked upon as the universal sort of the human head. We are promised, for instance, by M. Golberry, that the Ioloffs, whose shade of colour is a deep crystal clear pitch black, and who have woolly hair, are robust and well made, and have standard features. Their countenances, he declares, are ingenuous, and encourage confidence: they are honourable, hospitable, lavish, and faithful. The women are soft, very beautiful, well made, and of agreeable manners. On the alternative boundary of the equinoctial line, the Congo Negroes, as Pigafetta resolves, have not wide lips or hideous features; except in shade of colour they are very like the Portuguese.
