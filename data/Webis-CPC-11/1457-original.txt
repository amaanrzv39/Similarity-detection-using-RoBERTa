In reality, however, they had learned only half the story, as Bernard himself proved only a
few years later by opening up a new and quite unsuspected chapter. While experimenting in 1858
he discovered that there are certain nerves supplying the heart which, if stimulated, cause
that organ to relax and cease beating. As the heart is essentially nothing more than an aggregation
of muscles, this phenomenon was utterly puzzling and without precedent in the experience of
physiologists.
