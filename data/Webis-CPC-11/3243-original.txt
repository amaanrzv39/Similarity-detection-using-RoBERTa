The only sound policy was to confiscate the lands and divide them among the negroes, to whom,
sooner or later, suffrage must be given. Touching the matter in hand, Johnson was a fool to
have captured Davis, whom it would have been wiser to assist in escaping. Nothing would be
done with him, as the executive had only pluck enough to hang two poor devils such as Wirtz
and Mrs. Surratt. Had the leading traitors been promptly strung up, well; but the time for
that had passed. (Here, I thought, he looked lovingly at my neck, as Petit Andr√© was wont to
do at those of his merry-go-rounds.) He concluded by saying that it was silly to refuse me
permission to visit Jefferson Davis, but he would not say so publicly, as he had no desire
to relieve Johnson of responsibility.

There was no excuse for longer sporting with this radical Amaryllis either in shade or in sunshine;
so I sought Henry Winter Davis. Like the fallen angel, Davis preferred to rule in hell rather
than serve in heaven or on earth. With the head of Medusa and the eye of the Basilisk, he might
have represented Siva in a Hindoo temple, and was even more inaccessible to sentiment than
Thaddeus Stevens. Others, too numerous and too insignificant to particularize, were seen. These
were the cuttle-fish of the party, whose appointed duty it was to obscure popular vision by
clouds of loyal declamation.
