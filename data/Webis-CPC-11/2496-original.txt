The Directors have
not forgotten that mission, nor lost their interest in the Mongol tribes. Recent enquiries
have shown that the effort may be renewed with excellent prospects, on the China side of Mongolia,
and that the city of Peking will form a suitable base of operations. Among their present missionary
students the Directors believe that they have found a suitable man; and he will proceed in
the spring to Peking to take up his new position. The funds necessary at the outset have already
been provided in the generous gift of Mrs. Swan.

Generally in INDIA and CHINA the Directors have been enlarging their operations by the completion
and filling in of existing agencies.
