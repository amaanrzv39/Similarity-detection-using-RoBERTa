"We
are content," says Mr. Seward, in a despatch to Mr. Adams, "to rely upon the justice of our
cause, and our own resources and ability to maintain it." We have not sought the aid of any
power; we have only desired to sustain out admitted rights, and to be free from external interference.

It is surprising that Earl Russell should intimate his dissatisfaction that we have been less
quick to offence from France than from England. The reason why we should not, in his opinion,
feel so is the very reason why we should. He thinks, because our relations have been more intimate
with England, because we speak the same language and inherit the same Anglo-Saxon genius, that
therefore we should be more patient with her.
