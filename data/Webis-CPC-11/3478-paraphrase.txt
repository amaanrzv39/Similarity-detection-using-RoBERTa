Jesus said,"But, were it so, when you stand before the judgment throne of Him whose will, Jesus says, is that not one little one should either suffer from hunger, or nakedness, or be sick and perish, will you dare to tell Him that you knew that that was His will, but that you left it to the police." It's the police's job to do that.

Christians are the ones who want to create and enforce this new law. The funds should be payed with the Christians money.

$15,000 must be raised this year to be able to enforce this new law. Over 59,000 is being annually spent to the enforcement of the Factory Acts and to the Act for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Why does it seem like giving half of that amount to the enforcement of the law for Children is too much? Without it and the support from you their sufferings will go on.
