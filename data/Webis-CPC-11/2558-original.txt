If this long morning had passed slowly and sadly for our sorrowful little Madelon, it had been
a time of anxiety and uneasiness enough for Horace Graham also; who had never, I daresay, felt
more nervous than during these quiet hours when M. Linders, partly from the effects of his
accident, partly from the opiates that had been given him, lay unconscious. He was young in
his profession, and though clever and skilled enough in the technical part, he had had little
experience in what may be called the moral part of it, and he positively shrank form the moment
when this man, of whose life and character he knew something, should wake up, and he should
have to tell him that he was dying.
