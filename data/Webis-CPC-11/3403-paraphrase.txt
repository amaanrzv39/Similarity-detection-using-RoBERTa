Along the side of the Camanti, the flanks of the mountains were of great importance for the botanical motives of the expedition. There was yellow Garote leaking downward in a rocky ravine, the Bolivians felt successful. There was a sliver-gray Calisaya, it's leaves ribbed with carmine. This along with a half dozen other cinchonas, whose bark looked promising, were taken to Marcoy. He was needed to sketch, analyze and decorate the specimens with Latin names. This was a proud discovery. Science and commerce would surely boon. A new light was going to be shone on to the geographical locality of the most precious species of cinchona. Amazement struck the Bolivians. One would have thought they would be pleased to have discovered this kind of bark outside of their own country. Especially since it is hardly known to overpass the northern extremity of the valley of Apolobambal. The possibility that this discovery could rehabilitate, in the European markets and would give new life to the quinine-plants of Lower Peru should be exciting. Bolivia has for some time secured the most favorable reputation for it's barks, largely in part of the efforts of De  la Paz and the governments strangle hold on the monopoly of this system. This is also possible because of the abundant availability of two species, the Cinchona calisaya and the Boliviana. The latter of the two is considered most valued in the market. Yet Peru, which is awaiting the enterprise of the government,or the natural exhaustion of the forest to the south, can show twenty variations, many of them excellent in quality.
