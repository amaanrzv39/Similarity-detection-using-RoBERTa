The artist basically repeated himself, here where he created and felt.

The triptych, which once was upon the majestic alter of the church of San Domenico, is here and now located at one of the side altars to the right, the Virgin with the Holy Child on her knee, is placed in the centre, his left hand holds a rose, and his right hand is lifted in the act of benediction. Four angels, one with a flower basket, are surrounding the throne. Mary Magdalene, St. John Baptist, St. Matthew, and St. John the Evangelist are in the panels on the side.
