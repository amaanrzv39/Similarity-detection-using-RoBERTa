He began, however, towards the
end of the fifties and the beginning of the sixties, to be much noticed, not merely as the
deliverer of lectures, but as the contributor of essays of an exceedingly novel, piquant, and
provocative kind; and in 1865 these, or some of them, were collected and published under the
title of Essays in Criticism. These Essays--nine in number, besides a characteristic preface--dealt
ostensibly for the most part, if not wholly, with literary subjects,--"The Function of Criticism,"
"The Literary Influence of Academies," "The Guérins" (brother and sister), "Heine," "Pagan
and Mediæval Religious Sentiment," "Joubert," "Spinoza," and "Marcus Aurelius,"--but they extended
the purport of the title of the first of them in the widest possible way.
