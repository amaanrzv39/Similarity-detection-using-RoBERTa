Let us draw a veil over that
man's return to shore.

No mortal skill could have killed that fish.  Mortal luck (which is sometimes, as most statesmen
know, very great) might have done it, if the fish had been irretrievably fast hooked; as, per
contra, I once saw a fish of nearly four pounds hooked just above an alder bush, on the same
bank as the angler.  The stream was swift:  there was a great weed-bed above; the man had but
about ten feet square of swift water to kill the trout in.
