The élite of Frankfurt, on the rare occasions
when they do sup after going to the theatre or opera, generally order their meals at one of
the restaurants of the leading hotels; but Frankfurt does not, as a rule, keep late hours.

The Palmen Garten is a pleasant summer restaurant a little way out of the town, on the Bockenheimerstrasse.
It has a fine dining-hall, or you may sit at al-fresco tables while the regimental band discourses
excellent music. The cooking is good--German cuisine, but nothing high class. It is a very
pleasant spot to visit in the hot weather; on fête days one is treated there to the luxury
of fireworks, etc.

Buerose ought to be mentioned as a quiet restaurant, where there is a spécialité of hors-d'oeuvre
and excellent oysters.
