We do not need to question that volumes could be filled with recountings of sufferings and appaling conditions of cruelty, resulting, in most cases, with the victim's death. We also do not need to question the more hated moral abhorrence so prominent in Southern society, which opress the white people even more so than the black people-- of offspring sired by their masters, the mothers being the slave women-- sired in lust and sold for profit; lovely partially black persons searched for and bought for the simple pleasure of their owners; of families, where the daughters and wives by law are by slaves served that happend to be their own kin, such as sisters, brothers, uncles, that were born to a slave women, who gave in to her master's lust. Amalgamation is a Southern practice and taste, although not practiced in the North.
