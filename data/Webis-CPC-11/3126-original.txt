A boy, who has the
use of his limbs, and whose mind is untainted with prejudice, would, in all probability, prefer
a substantial cart, in which he could carry weeds, earth and stones, up and down hill, to the
finest frail coach and six that ever came out of a toy-shop: for what could he do with the
coach after having admired, and sucked the paint, but drag it cautiously along the carpet of
a drawing-room, watching the wheels, which will not turn, and seeming to sympathize with the
just terrors of the lady and gentleman within, who are certain of being overturned every five
minutes? When he is tired of this, perhaps, he may set about to unharness horses which were
never meant to be unharnessed; or to currycomb their woollen manes and tails, which usually
come off during the first attempt.
