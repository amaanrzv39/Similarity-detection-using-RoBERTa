The abandon of the entrances of the three portals are awash with colossal statues, thirty- nine in number, apery patriarchs, prophets, kings, bishops, virgins and martyrs. On the trumeau of the axial aboideau is a accomplished bronze of the Virgin Mary; on the abandon of this trumeau are bas-reliefs apery the Fall of Man, of whose apology Mary should be the instrument.

It is absolutely appropriate of a medieval abbey that we should find, on the lintels and side-posts of these doorways, emblems of agronomical plan in the assorted seasons of the year, as able-bodied as altered symbols of arts and handicrafts. Amid the carvings of these doorways are the heroes and saints of the Old Testament, types and antecedents of the Messiah, as able-bodied as celebrated scenes, apery the Redemption of the World, the Conversion of the Gentiles, the Resurrection of the Dead, the Last Judgment, the Condemnation of the Wicked, the Reception of the Just into the habitations of the blest. Finally, the Assumption and Coronation of the Blessed Virgin sums up, with an artistic legend, this alternation of Christian article perpetuated in stone.

But the medieval ability is many-sided, and never annoyed with that which is admirable alone; and this arresting arrangement of Christian abstraction would not be complete to the apperception of the medieval artisan unless he had crowned the angles of his barrio with a alternation of aberrant gargoyles and allegoric statues, apery the streams that watered the alluvial paradise, while at the acme of the roof are niched angles address instruments of music.
