The cosmetic condition of the penis as a copulating organ is a thing of some importance, and
this should not be overlooked; for, although the particular dimension, shape, or peculiarity
of the penile end never figures prominently in the complaints of women who apply for divorce,--the

its condition is the original, silent and unseen, as well as unconscious power behind the throne
that is at the bottom of the whole business in more than one case.
