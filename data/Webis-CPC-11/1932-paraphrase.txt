I see the faces of the many men, women, and children here, and I am in awe of the courtesy, intelligence, and the gracefulness of almost everyone.  And I wonder to myself, is it possible, they all seem to be musicians.  

As I think about the many faces that popped out at me in that human/rabbitlike alcove I remember something said to me "Actually, you are not wrong.  You will discover that they are of high moral standards.  Just as much as they are physically and intellectually superior."
