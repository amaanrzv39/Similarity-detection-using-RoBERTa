I've never run across this passage before or known of the atrocity it records so I'd be happy to have more information on the subject.

J.S. Warden:

Turlehydes--During Ireland's great famine of 1331, it's reported that:

The starving people had a fortuitious experience on June 24 when a great number of large sea creatures, called turlehydes, came into Dublin Bay and were found ashore at the mouth of the River Dodder.
