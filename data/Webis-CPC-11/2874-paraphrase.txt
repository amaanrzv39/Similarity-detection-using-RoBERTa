My wandering path took me under the edge of the woods that bordered a mountain stream. Not the smallest of the debt we owe the appealing brook is that it wears a deep stream, whose sharp sides are clothed with a thick growth of waving trees--beech, white and black birches, maple, and chestnut--in refreshing and delightful bewilderment. The stream never left my side as I walked slowly down, peering in every bush for nests, and at last I parted the branches like a screen and stepped into it. It was a cool green seclusion, a shrine, one of nature's most enchanting nooks, tucked away in my dreams and birds and--woodchucks, one of which sat straight up and looked earnestly at me out of his great brown eyes. 
I sat on the low-growing limb of a tree, and swayed by the wind outside.
