Mars wasn't really inviting to Miran ships because they couldn't land in the northwestern or the south central regions.  Their great beams had been calculated so exactly that they were effective at a range of almost twelve hundred miles.

A half-hearted attack was made on Deenmor station, as the Mirans were pretty unsettled about UV beams of fifteen feet.  When two ships were damaged, the Mirans retreated to Jupiter, although they held Phobos and Deimos.
