I don't exactly think of myself as having a green thumb, but I can assure you that if I'd fully comprehended the essence or importance of the orchard back when we arrived in Kansas nineteen years ago, things would have gone much better.  In particular, I don't think that it's possible to succeed if your orchard is on upland and exposed.  If it is, you could maybe use it as a family orchard, assuming that you could plant a reasonable windbreak around it (I'd recommend on the south side).  But even if someone gave it to me as a gift, I wouldn't take even a largeish orchard on exposed upland, even with apple trees thrown in sufficient to plant it, if the condition were that I'd have to plant it and take care of it for a decade or more. I've never seen even one such orchard that I'd want.  I recommend that you find low ground, with a slope going northward and eastward, with raised land or at least good protection from timber to the south and the west, and the land tending towards bottom.  I believe that you could raise excellent apples here profitably, given a good choice of varieties, as well as good land and location.  Storing apples in cellars is a bad idea; it's much better to find a suitable cave where they can be kept as cold as can be without actually freezing.  Last autumn, I was able to sell my best apples at a price between forty and fifty cents a bushel.  Some, though, I kept in barrels back in the cave, because there was strong demand for them later.  Around Christmas, I got $1.25 a bushel, and then even $1.35.  I'd contracted with a grocer that they'd sell them for 15%, and that's what I made.  I still even have some in my cave in great condition (as of April 27).  And I open the cave up when the temperature drops at night.
