Use one as a lotion one night and the other the next. This will often
prove a permanent cure, while a better, less noticeable state is certain. The remedy is one,
however, that will take time and patience. The superfluous hair will gradually become light-colored
and almost white, and the ammonia will, if used persistently, deaden the growth. Do not expect
the bleach to take effect right away, for it won't. If the skin is at all irritated rub on
pure, thick cream.

RECIPES FOR THE HAIR.

    Liquid Verbena Soap: Cut in small pieces one-half pound of pure
    imported castile soap. Put in porcelain kettle with two quarts of
    warm water and dissolve by boiling. When cold it should be of the
    consistency of rather thin cream; if thicker, add more water.
