One could posit that the pressure exerted by wind is not soley proportional to the amount of surface exposed.  Pressure plates in general aren't large, ranging from 1/2 to 1/4 sf to three sf.  They can be oblong or eliptical.  For a flat surface, and for oblong and eliptical shapes, the formula P-.003v^2 is accurate to an acceptable degree.

In general, the pressure is what is being measured in the in the anemometer, though usually the scale is graduated as in a velocity scale.
