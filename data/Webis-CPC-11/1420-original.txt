Now if there
must be earth, there must be fire.  For if one of two opposites is natural or necessary, the
other must be necessary too, each, in fact, implying the necessity of the other.  For the two
have the same substantial basis, only the positive form is naturally prior to the negative;
for instance, warm is prior to cold.  And in the same way motionlessness and heaviness are
predicated in virtue of the absence of motion and lightness, i.e. the latter are essentially prior.
