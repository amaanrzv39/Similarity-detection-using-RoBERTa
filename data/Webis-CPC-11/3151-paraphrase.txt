These are essentially comprised with different links and such links are formed by a pair of parallel plates.  These plates are especially connected by a central bolt forming a scissors joint and again they are perfectly connected by chain links.  These links are present under the cage and it is highly tied above by the winding rope. The outer sideâ€™s links are specially designed with projecting lugs above.  When they are closed by the load, its width will normally permit it to enter a funnel shaped guide which is situated on a cross bar of the frame.   They are fixed from some distance above the bank level.  When they are reaching the narrower portion of the guide at the top, then the plates will automatically be forced apart and it will release the ropes and bring the lugs into contact with the top of the cross bar.  This will finally secure the cage from falling carefully.

There are mainly three different principal patters existing in normal use such as king, ormerod and walker. They are in fact very capable and efficient to create the speed of the cage at arrival is not excessive.
