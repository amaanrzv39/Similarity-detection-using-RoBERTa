Akbar had not been an observant Muslim for a long time. When the Ulemâs were no longer in power, he became outspoken about this. He declared that the Koran was written by men, and said that its commandments were unnecessary. He stated that Mohammed had performed no miracles and claimed that his prophecies were meaningless. He even disputed the notion that the faithful would be rewarded in the next life. Instead, he professed the doctrine of the Brahmans and Sûfis, which teaches that the soul has many existences before it is completely purified and becomes divine.

Akbar refuted the the Ulemâs' assertions that all people are born with a natural inclination toward Islam and that Arabic is the natural language of humanity (a claim made by the Jews regarding Hebrew and the Brahmans regarding Sanskrit). This he did by an uncharacteristically harsh experiment: In 1579, he arranged for twenty infants to be raised in silence. The children's parents were compensated, and the babies were placed in a remote nursery where they were cared for by nurses who spoke not a word. Four years later, it was found that the surviving children could neither speak nor profess the teachings of Islam. It is said that the children later learned, with difficulty, to speak.
