The purpose of the letter was to inform Don Tomas that he had returned to England,
was claiming "magnificent lands," and in brief to prepare his old acquaintances to befriend

and much gossip about Melipilla, and what had become of the old circle. But to the astonishment
and dismay of the Claimant's attorney, Mr. Holmes, Pedro Castro reminded his old correspondent,
that when among them he had gone by the name of Arthur Orton.
