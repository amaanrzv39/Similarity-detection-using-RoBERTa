It did, and now that her boy has grown
to be a man he comes to her in his officer's uniform to say,... Ah, these partings! They are
really the death-hours of their dear ones, and the women know it, although, like Andromache,
they go on "smiling through their tears."

With what brave and silent hearts they face the sequel too! The mother of Sub-Lieutenant So-and-So
receives letters from him nearly every other week. Such cheerful little pencil scribblings!
"Dearest Mother, I have a jolly comfortable dug-out now--three planks and a truss of straw,
and I sleep on it like a top." Or, perhaps, "You see they have sent me back to the Base after
six weeks under fire, and now I have a real, real room, and a real, real bed!" The dear old
darling!
