While I was  phoning to a person  the operator without any reason switched me to the supervisor. Now I think he done this by the inspiration of Olympus.  Anyway I talked to the supervisor and explained  that I am a busy person although the charge of the War Office , Timper control and L.D.C.S were missing at the moment.
           She behaved politely and asked my number, name, address , the date and time of the day , the number of times I rung up and to whom and when and all. She even asked my date of birth and whether I was single and all .Then I protested.
