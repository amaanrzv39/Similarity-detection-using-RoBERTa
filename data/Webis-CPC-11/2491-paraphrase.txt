From Newmarket I heard, that a very nice week's racing was missed by me and Stud Produce Stakes choice was more of the mark, I accurately hit the bullseye--(what a pain the bull may have suffered)--in my one "Song coming from Birdcage". which was warbled in the ear of a friend from racing, the one whom I meeted with.' it was actually a plan of the July Stakes and ran thus:--

The night was black when "Portland Bill"
ran by Chesil Beach! And faith drummed high deep in his heart, that he the goal might reach!
In case of "Milford" Haven sits in sight!--one attempt and he's there! But watch!--At last--he was caught--he's passed!--just by the Judge's seat.
