And Tiny Bear squeaked out,

"Oh! here is a little girl in my bed; and it must be she who has eaten my breakfast and broken
my chair."

Then Father Bear growled,

"LET US EAT HER UP;"

And Mother Bear growled, "LET US EAT HER UP;"

And Tiny Bear squeaked,

"LET US EAT HER UP."

The noise they made woke Golden Hair, and you may imagine how frightened she was when she saw
the three bears. She started out of bed, and jumped at once out of the window. The bears rushed
after her, and Father Bear caught her golden hair in his teeth, but she left a lock behind,
and still ran on. Then the three bears all jumped out after her, but they fell one on the top
of the other and rolled over and over, and while they were picking themselves up, little Golden
Hair ran home, and they were not able to catch her.
