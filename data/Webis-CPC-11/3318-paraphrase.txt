here is a little more to see the Royal Exchange, except that the interior decorations are very tastefully executed, and therefore, we turn now to this leviathan Bank of England - to long, irregular, and by no means imposing our line of building on the left. This is William Cobbett's Old Lady of Threadneedle Street, whose rickety constitution and powers not - by the fact that the financier bold and blundering - betokened almost immediate dissolution more than a quarter century ago. Other people, less dominated by unreasoning prejudice than the author of "Political Register," were wrong in the same notion, and it is quite possible that even now there are people who have faith as Cobbett was - as we are said one of Mr. Disraeli novels, Greek mythology is still belief that a fragment of humanity existing somewhere in the mountains of Syria. In any case, since the late Sir Robert Peel is placed beyond the power of the governor and company to indulge in hazardous or irregular courses, it is abundantly clear that to doubt the perfect stability of the Bank of England is equivalent to questioning the infallibility numeracy. The treasure chests in this unit and there is huge now - as we learn from published weekly, returns, provision for Sir Robert's - astonishing value between L.14, L.15 and 000,000, 000,000 pounds in gold and silver! - An amount that figures gliding smoothly and fairly shallow on the pen or tongue, but a mass of treasure, however, that few people can achieve a proper and distinct conception.
