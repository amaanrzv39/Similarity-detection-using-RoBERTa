"Thence it is," writes a sub-prior to
his friend, "that we bring forth the sentences of the divine law, like sharp arrows, to attack
the enemy. Thence we take the armour of righteousness, the helmet of salvation, the shield
of faith, and the sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God."[4] With such an end in view
Reculfus of Soissons required his clergy to have a missal, a lectionary, the Gospels, a martyrology,
an antiphonary, a psalter, a book of forty homilies of Gregory, and as many Christian books
as they could get (879).
