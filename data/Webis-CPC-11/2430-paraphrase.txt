dont go yet, my powerful love, stay a bit more and Zenia's step shall lead thee on, to Hayna's golden shoreline, No pale man's feet have ever touched, the vale that sleeps there, or violently pushed the metal bird from its nest, or Gato from his lair; But in the center of small mountains, there are many mines, and all the wealth they hold, shall be my Diez thine, and all my people shall be your friends, our warrier god guards you, with Zenia's chest your unwaivering shield, your love her good payment.
