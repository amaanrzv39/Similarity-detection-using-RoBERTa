During a remarkable wet summer, Joe Vernon, whose vocal taste and humour contributed for many years to the entertainment of the frequenters of Vauxhall Gardens, but who was not quite so good a timist in money matters as in music, meeting an acquaintance who had the misfortune to hold some of his unhonoured paper, was asked by him, not uninterestedly, how the gardens were going on? "Oh, swimmingly!" answered the jocose Joe. "Glad to hear it," retorted the creditor, "their swimming state, I hope, will cause the singers to liquidate their notes."

Mr. Samuel Deacon, a most respectable Baptist minister, who resided at Barton in Leicestershire, was not peculiarly happy in his cast of countenance or general appearance; conscious of the silly ridicule his unprepossessing tout ensemble occasionally excited, he made the following good-humoured, quaint remark:-- 

"The carcass that you look at so, Is not Sam Deacon, you must know, But 'tis the carriage--the machine, Which Samuel Deacon rideth in."

ADVANTAGES OF LOQUACITY 

A very pretty woman, who was tediously loquacious, complained one day to Madame de Sevigné, that she was sadly tormented by her lovers. "Oh, Madame," said Madame de Sevigné to her, with a smile, "it is very easy to get rid of them: you have only to speak."
