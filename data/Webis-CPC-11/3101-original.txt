Which really remarkable prophecy was fully borne out by the race, in fact, so close a description
might almost have been written after the race--a great compliment to my powers of divination!

Next week takes us to Bibury and Stockbridge. and if this hot weather continues, the motto
of the Club should be, "Dum vivo Bibere"--or, freely translated--"Half the soda, please!" The
race to which I propose to give my attention is the Alington Plate, and as I am nothing if
not thorough, you will see that my tip is influenced by my being at the Seaside?

Yours devotedly, LADY GAY.

ALINGTON PLATE SELECTION.

  The storm was raging through the night,
    I tossed upon my pillow,
  And pitied any luckless wight
    Who tossed upon the "Billow!"
