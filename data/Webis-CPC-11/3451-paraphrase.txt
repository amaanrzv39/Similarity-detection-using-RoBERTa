If I have to die, please take care of my wife and my four daughters. They're currently staying at the coppersmith's house on Erbis Street.

"What is that?" said Roller, moving his dark lantern, shining the bright light on the dying man's pale face.

Hofmann lifted his eyes to look at the figure walking towards him. In a broken voice he said: "Comrade, I have been struck with a cold Swedish bullet. Promise me, my friend, that when i die, I will have an honorable burial in my new uniform, not the clothing of a miner. When I'm buried, let them all say: "A good journey to thee, old comrade!""

"A good journey to thee, old comrade," responded Roller whole-heartedly. As he said that, Hofmann suddenly stopped moving and it was clear he was about to die.

Conrad and Dollie did as Roller would do. They folded their hands and began to pray the Our Father over the dying man. There were loud sounds of the Swedish men firing their guns outside and there was the constant boom coming from the cannons striking the ground. The sounds were a strange contrast to the quiet gathering inside.

"You have come at a terrible time, my young friends," Roller said. "You should probably stay here until it settles down outside. The bullets could hit anyone at anytime. The Swedish don't care if you're young or old, big or little. There's no difference to them. They'll strike anyone.
