The All Father belief and social progress do not necessirly conincide.  Theoretically, living in coastal conditions foster both social progress and the All Father belief.  This is not true from the northern coast to the centre.  The All Father belief is secret on the coast.  It was not reported by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen.  The south-east tribes, which are further from the coast, profess the All Father belief and are low in social progress.
