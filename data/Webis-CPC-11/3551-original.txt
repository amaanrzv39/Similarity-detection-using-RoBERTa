Those who begin to lay in their stock of Christmas books early should remember PINE CONES,
which will delight the heart of many a boy and girl during the holidays.--Boston Transcript.

Mr. Willis Boyd Allen is already known to the readers of the Sunday-school Times as one of
our best writers of stories for children. His style is marked by a simplicity, naturalness
and lack of sensationalism; and his stories move with the freedom of boyish nature and of the
open air.--Sunday-school Times.

A decidedly bright book--sweet and pure as the pine woods themselves. It is a story of city
boys and girls spending the Christmas holidays with Uncle Will, away down in the Maine woods.
Such delightful times as they have, even if they did have to camp out in the woods all the
first night!--Golden Rule.

PINE CONES is enlivened by tales of sea and land, sometimes humorous, sometimes pathetic, and
always interesting.--Portland Transcript.

Profusely illustrated, and brimful of incident, adventure and fun.--Wide Awake.

A charming book of adventures, written in a bright and fascinating style.--Journal of Education.

It is good, wholesome reading that will make boys nobler and girls gentler. A breezy, joyous,
entertaining book.--Chicago Inter-Ocean.
