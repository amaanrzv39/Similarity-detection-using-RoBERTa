In the city of Hong Kong we saw a lot of vices. They had been manufactured in the Orient to suit the demands of some heretic memberes of Christianity.

When we stayed in Hong Kong, there was a great celebration for the repair and the rededication of an important Buddhist temple. Many thousands of Chinese formed a procession and came to join the celebration.
