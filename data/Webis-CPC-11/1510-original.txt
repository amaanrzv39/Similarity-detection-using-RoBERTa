Frequent allusion is made to it in the
play. Falstaff's page says to his master, on seeing the Chief Justice:

    "Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed the prince for
    striking him about Bardolph."

And Falstaff in the same scene thus addresses Gascoigne:

    "For the box of the ear that the prince gave you,--he gave it
    like a rude prince, and you took it like a sensible lord. I have
    checked him for it, and the young lion repents."
