Mr. Walter Camp, for thirty years the moving spirit, organizer, adviser, and athletic strategist
of Yale, was chosen chairman of the Athletic Department, with the title General Commissioner
of Athletics for the United States Navy.

Taking up his task in midsummer, 1917, three months after declaration of war by the United
States, Mr. Camp at once brought his ability, experience, and versatility into play in organizing
recreational sport in the navy stations. By this time every naval district was fast filling
with its quota of enlisted men, and the plan of the Navy Department to place an even hundred
thousand men in the stations before the close of the year was well along toward completion.

Swept from college, counting-room, professional office, and factory, often from homes of luxury
and elegance, to the naval stations, where, in many cases arrangements to house them were far
from complete, the young men of the navy found themselves surrounded by conditions to which
they pluckily and patiently reconciled themselves, but which could not do otherwise than provoke
restlessness and discomfort.

Under these conditions the work of the Navy Commission was particularly timely and important,
and that of Mr. Camp was of conspicuous value through the physical training and mental stimulus
which it provided for patriotic, yet half homesick young Americans, from whom not only material
comfort and luxury, but entertainment of all kinds, including recreational sport, had been taken.
