But Henry, who in no department of his public
duties ever willingly deputed to others what he could personally attend to himself, carried
the same principle into the exercise of the charities of private life; and has here left a
pattern of Christian sympathy and lowliness of mind, of genuine philanthropy, and the sincere
affection of true friendship, worthy of prince and peasant alike to imitate. Bishop Courtenay
is said to have been among Henry's chosen friends, recommended to him by the singular qualities
of his head and his heart.
