I don't know what the gentleman means by an expression of the public will since there were two candidates for President prsented to the House of Representatives with votes tied.  The Consitution gives us the right and duty to name the one we thought should win, taking note of the tenor of public will.  The gentleman from Virginia probably had a preference, as did others, but the Consitution doesn't allow that to hold sway.
