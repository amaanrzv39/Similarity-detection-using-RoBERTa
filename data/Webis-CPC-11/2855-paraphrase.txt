The latter are reached by means of tall scaffoldings of strong poles of bamboo, often over a hundred feet in height. The nests are swept from the rock with a pole terminating in a small iron spatula, and carrying near the extremity a wax candle; falling to the ground, which is floored with guano several feet thick, they are gathered up in baskets. The white nests are gathered five times in the year at intervals of about a month, the black nests usually only twice; as lots of as five tons of black nests are sometimes taken from one gigantic cave in the coursework of the annual gathering. Each cave, or, in the case of sizable caves, each natural subdivision of it, is claimed as the property of some individual, who holds it during his lifetime and transmits it to his heirs.
