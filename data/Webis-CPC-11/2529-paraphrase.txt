"Not happy! with such an equipage,neatest turn-out. I ever set eyes on. I had half a mind to ride up to her carriage and advance a claim to her gratitude."

"Gratitude? Oh, for your part in that miserable affair of which you told me? "Not a miserable affair for her; but certainly I never got any good from it. Trouble for nothing! Basta! No use looking back."

"No use; but who can help it?" said Arabella Crane, sighing heavily. Then as if eager to change the subject, she added abruptly, "Mr. Rugge has been here twice this morning, highly excited the child will not act. He says you are bound to make her do so!"
