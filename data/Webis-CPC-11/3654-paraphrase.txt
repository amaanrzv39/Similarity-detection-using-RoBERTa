Some time later, after experiencing a tiring walk through the abrasive debris, we arrived at the point from which this glorious flood had burst. There was a gigantic piece of the bank left on either side of the valley , with a big gulf flowing between. We did not quite expect to find this; the newspapers had stated that everything in its entirety had been washed away. A complete half of the whole thing still exists, which does include pieces of that central depression which was mentioned. The statement of everything being washed away was not the case. It is more important than it may seem to report this finding. One theory has been greatly embraced regarding the mystery of the Parallel Roads of Glenroy-- which is that by lakes these roads were produced, and long since ruptured its boundaries and been discharged. The question has been asked: Where was the dam located that held in the lake? if there did happen to be a dam, couldn't we expect that it would not be completely washed away? Wouldn't we find remnants of it along the sides of the valley--the disintegration of the middle being enough to allow all the waters to flow out? As we observe the pieces left of either side of the Bilberry banks, we can see the applicability and strength of these questions, and the lake theory we shall admit is thus far diminished. A small stream is visibly flowing, in the bottom of the rift--the exact stream which only a few months ago increasingly took a on fearful form. Visible marks where the ground had been submerged are seen from within a mile up the valley.
