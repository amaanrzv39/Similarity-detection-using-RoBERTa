"The very day I received your letter, Monseigneur Chalandon, our worthy Bishop, came to Ars,
to call on my holy cure. I mentioned you to him. He told me he had written to you. He also
says that you must not begin without some means and better health. Pray very hard that God
may give you both. I think the souls in Purgatory ought to take this opportunity to prove that
they have influence with God. Their interests are at stake in the removal of these obstacles."
Mdlle. ---- had asked to make this novena conjointly with M. Vianney; and she soon received
the following letter:

"It is to-day, the 9th of January, that our much-wished-for novena is to begin. The souls in
Purgatory are interested in the re-establishment of your health. I am, you know, but the echo
of our good and holy cure. Your director gives you excellent advice. You might, indeed, as
soon as you have means enough of support for one year, go to Paris for a while, and come back
again to forward the work in the same way you are doing now. You say, 'St. Vincent de Paul
used to begin his works with nothing.' So he did. But then, as my good cure observes, 'St.
Vincent de Paul was a great saint!'"

According to M. Vianney's advice, on the 19th of January, 1856, the foundress went to Paris,
where she met some persons who had, like her, resolved to devote themselves to the service
of the souls in Purgatory; but who were quite at a loss how to proceed, and had no means of
support.
