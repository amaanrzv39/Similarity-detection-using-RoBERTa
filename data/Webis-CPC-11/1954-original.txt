We were none of us profound enough to quote or produce any facts from the monuments
and records of the early converts to account for the expression; but I conceive it probable
that a solution could be readily given by some of your learned correspondents. The burning
of the dead does not appear to be in itself an anti-christian ceremony, nor necessarily connected
with Pagan idolatries, and therefore might have been tolerated in the case of Gentile believers
like any other indifferent usage.

CINIS.
