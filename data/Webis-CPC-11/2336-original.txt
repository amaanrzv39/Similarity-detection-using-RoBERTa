Nevertheless, this dreary theatre was, in default of anything better, visited
again and again by British officers and others. A friend of mine in the Guards told me with
a sigh that he had actually watched the performances of these accomplished infants for no less
than seven nights.

There are several music halls in Capetown. I have visited similar entertainments in Constantinople,
Cairo, Beyrout and other towns of the East, but I never saw anything to match some of these
Capetown haunts for out-and-out vulgarity.
