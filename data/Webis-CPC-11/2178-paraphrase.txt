When looking to restock a lake or river with fish, you must make sure the water can support them.  Mainly, is there enough food?  Look for lots of plants both in the water and on the banks.  If the shore is bare, plan on adding quickly-growing trees such as Alder or Willow.  Both will add not only food, but provide shaded areas over the water.

You must also pay special attention to the types of fish you introduce and avoid competing species.  For example, trout eat young perch.
