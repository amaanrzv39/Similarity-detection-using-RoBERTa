To a resolution on the number nine it appeared to clearly point, just like in music the tonic is pointed to by the sensitive seventh points. It would understandably be explained if nine could only be established...Man's number in creation is five (and isn't also five eyes the facial measurement of man?)when five is added to four it makes nine, the number of material elements that he dominates, which in turn would show the greatness or completeness of man.
