Listen. A rich man is a weighted man. When I declaim against the Royal Family I do not deign to speak to the beasts who form the Royal Family-- mere people are so insignificant... In Brazil we laugh at the idea that your insignificant country could have anything to say to the free citizens of Canada, Oz and the US. Brazil shows you how to oust a monarchy.

Carnegie, Listen! As I know that it will scar the thin skin of a democrat I refuse to address you as "Mr". The nonsense you have spouted mixed with a terrible hypocrisy. But it is true, what you say, "persons are so very insignificant"
