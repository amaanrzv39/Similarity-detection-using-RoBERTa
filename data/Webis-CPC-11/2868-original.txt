Prof. Henry says the sound of the whistle is distributed horizontally. It is, however, much
stronger in the plane containing the lower edge of the bell than on either side of this plane.
Thus, if the whistle is standing upright in the ordinary position, its sound is more distinct
in a horizontal plane passing through the whistle than above it or below it.

The steam fog-whistle is the same instrument ordinarily used on steamboats and locomotives.
It is from 6 to 18 inches in diameter, and is operated by steam under a pressure of from 50
to 100 pounds. An engine takes its steam from the same boiler, and by an automatic arrangement
shuts off and turns on the steam by opening and closing its valves at determined times.
