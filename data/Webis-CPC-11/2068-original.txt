Indeed, I know no other dramatist who could have re-told this beautiful English tale with such
tenderness and such power, neither losing the charm of the old story nor forgetting the conditions
of the new form.  The sentiment of the poet and the science of the playwright are exquisitely
balanced in it.  For though in prose it is a poem, and while a poem it is also a play.

But fortunate as Mr. Wills has been in the selection of his subject and in his treatment of
it, he is no less fortunate in the actors who interpret his work.
