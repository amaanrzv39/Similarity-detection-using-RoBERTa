It consists of a flat steel blade, about
one foot in length, of which the widest part (between one and two inches) is about four inches
from the tip. The tip and lateral edges of the blade are sharp, and its haft is lashed with
strips of rattan to the end of a wooden shaft. The extremity of the haft is bent outwards from
the shaft, to prevent its being dragged off from the latter. The shaft is of tough wood and
about seven feet in length; its butt end is usually shod with iron.
