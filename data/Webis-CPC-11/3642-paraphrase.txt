Many slave masters, even in the parishes where the slaves were freed, sent their most valuable slaves to other states, such as Texas and Alabama. Some of the masters even followed their slaves to those states. News of the Emancipation Proclamation took some time to reach the parishes located far from Union headquarters, in some cases, long after it had been passed. Even then, it was not uncommon to have the proclamation read at sword point, with federal solders forcing slave owners to tell their slaves this important news.[99]

After the accession of General Banks to 1876, the history of Louisiana become one of turmoil, struggle and strife, centered around the black man. [100] Louisiana was no longer a history of romance but a grim war, with our black brethren, by no fault of their own, at the center of this struggle. Various Political parties arose in 1862. For example, the Free State party wanted representation based only on white population, though they favored the abolition of slavery. This platform was opposed by the Union Democrat party, which rejected secession, but favored slavery. The party believed emancipation of slaves was a war measure and hoped that after the hostilities and struggles ceased,  slavery could reasonably be reestablished. Both parties' plans fell flat.[101]. The colored man would become a more prominent political factor for years to come.  

Louisiana had more than one class of colored men; the free men and the men who were freed; a minor but important distinction among the colored people. The free colored men held a higher, aristocratic stature.
