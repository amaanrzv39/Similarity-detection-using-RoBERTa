The infinite variety of vegetable forms, all beautiful, and each one different in its
beauty, is all the result of simple laws. It is true that these simple laws are not as yet
all discovered; but the one great discovery of Phyllotaxis, which shows that all plants follow
one law in the arrangement of their leaves upon the stem, thereby intimates in unmistakable
language the simplicity and unity of all organic vegetable laws; and a similar assurance is
given by the morphological reduction of all parts to a metamorphosed leaf.
