Often and often have
those steps of the Duomo run with blood of Baglioni, Oddi, Arcipreti, and La Staffa. Once the
whole church had to be washed with wine and blessed anew before the rites of Christianity could
be resumed in its desecrated aisles. It was here that within the space of two days, in 1500,
the catafalque was raised for the murdered Astorre, and for his traitorous cousin Grifonetto
Baglioni. Here, too, if more ancient tradition does not err, were stretched the corpses of
twenty-seven members of the same great house at the end of one of their grim combats.

No Italian city illustrates more forcibly than Perugia the violent contrasts of the earlier
Renaissance. This is perhaps its most essential characteristic--that which constitutes its
chief Ã¦sthetic interest.
