THE country of Kakekikoku, as its name suggests, lies in the vicinity of Timbuctoo, the well-known
African resort; and at the present time, when so much interest is centred upon that little-known
land, it may be profitable to our readers, as well as to the writer, to give some information
about it.

A famous Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, who has travelled widely, not only in this
country but in Belgium and the Channel Islands, has stated that Kakekikoku is richly endowed
with the bewilderments, perils and mysteries of primitive and unexplored African territory.
A warlike and exclusive folk, the Kakekikokuans extend a red-hot welcome to the foreigner who
ventures within their borders.
