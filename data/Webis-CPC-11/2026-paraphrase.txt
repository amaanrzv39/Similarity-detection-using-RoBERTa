The Executive appointed Mr. David Ridgely to undertake the responsibility of properly maintaining the archives belonging to the state. It was this State Librarian who woke up the Legislature to the manner in which archives belonging to the state were improperly and recklessly guarded by those on whom this responsibility has been entrusted upon. For the past several years were thrown into the dustbin as mere non-entities, and valuable folios too. Lately, this has been the same trend by those who took the responsibility from their predecessors.
