Ordinarily very careful how I spoke about women ( for my loves having lain much
in my mother's house, caution had become habitual to me). I one night talked about virgins
and of getting them. He said such things were done; that Harridans got a young lass, if well
paid for it, but that they generally sold the girls half-a-dozen times over, "and," said he,
"they train the young bitches so, there is no finding them out; you may pay for one who was
first fucked by a butcher boy, and then her virginity sold to a dandy; you may pay for it my
boy, and not find out you have been done." I pondered much over this, and the next night returned
to the subject. His opinion was that an old stager like him was not to be done; but that any
randy young beggar would go up the girl, and flatter himself he had had a virgin, if the girl
was cunning. "When you see the tight covered hole with your eye, find it tight to your little
finger, and then tight to your cock, my boy; when you have satisfied your eye, your finger,
and your cucumber, and seen blood on it, you may be sure you have had one,--and not otherwise."

Thought I, "I am going to be humbugged." Another week, no letter, I went to her lodings, and
found she had taken away everything she had with her. That night I told a little of my hopes
to the Major, not telling him who the kind lady was, or where she was gone; but it made him
laugh. "You are done brown my boy, done brown; that woman will never turn up again."
