MAY-DAY GAMES.

(For the Mirror.)

This day of joyous festivity has almost ceased to be the harbinger of mirth and jollity; and
the gambols of our forefathers are nearly forgotten amidst the high notions of modern refinement.
Time was when king, lords, and commons hailed May-day morning with delight, and bowed homage
to her fair and brilliant queen. West end and city folks united in their freaks, ate, drank,
and joined the merry dance from morning dawn till close of day. Thus in an old ballad of those
times we find

  The hosiers will dine at the Leg,
  The drapers at the sign of the Brush,
  The fletchers to Robin Hood will go,
  And the spendthrift to Beggar's bush.
