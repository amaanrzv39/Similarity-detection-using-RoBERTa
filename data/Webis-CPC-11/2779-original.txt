The loss on the part of the natives was supposed not to be greater than upon the former occasion,
but its results were longer and more fearfully remembered. Three men belonging to the colony,
serving at the guns on the eastern post were wounded, Gardiner and Crook dangerously, Tines
mortally; the Agent received three bullets through his clothes, but providentially escaped
without any bodily hurt.

There was at this time but little surgical knowledge, less skill, and no instruments at the
settlement. Its dispensary was liberally furnished with James's powders and febrifuges; but
for broken bones, and extracting pieces of pot-metal or copper ship-bolts from shattered limbs,
there had been no provision whatever.
