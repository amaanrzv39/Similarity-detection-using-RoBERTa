Visions of the unseen Switzerland

Weyburn named the Spring holiday time, the season of the flowering Alpine robes.  He promised
welcome, pressed for a promise of the visit.  Warmly it was given.  'We will; we will indeed!'

'I shall look forward,' he said.

There was nothing else for him or for her, except to doat on the passing minute that slipped
when seized.  The looking forward turned them to the looking back at the point they had flown
from, and yielded a momentary pleasure, enough to stamp some section of a picture on their
memories, which was not the burning now Love lives for, in the clasp, if but of hands.  Desire
of it destroyed it.  They swung to the future, swung to the present it made the past, sensible
to the quick of the now they could not hold.
