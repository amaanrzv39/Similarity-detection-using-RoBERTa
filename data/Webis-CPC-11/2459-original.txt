And then came into the
place the duke's son of Orkney, and then they began to do many deeds of arms.

When Sir Tristram saw them so begin, he said to Palomides: How feel ye yourself? may ye do
this day as ye did yesterday? Nay, said Palomides, I feel myself so weary, and so sore bruised
of the deeds of yesterday, that I may not endure as I did yesterday. That me repenteth, said
Sir Tristram, for I shall lack you this day. Sir Palomides said: Trust not to me, for I may
not do as I did. All these words said Palomides for to beguile Sir Tristram. Sir, said Sir
Tristram unto Sir Gareth, then must I trust upon you; wherefore I pray you be not far from
me to rescue me. An need be, said Sir Gareth, I shall not fail you in all that I may do.
