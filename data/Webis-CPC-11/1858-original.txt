When CAMERON, "doing a bit of bounce," as BRODRICK said, asked PREMIER whether, supposing
Opposition resolved to move Vote of Censure, a day wouldn't be found for them, Ministerialists
cheered and Opposition responded. House never more like public school than when a fight is
being got up. Now spirit rose to bubbling point; cheering and counter-cheering incessant. Only
Mr. G. sat silent, apparently so deeply interested in Orders that he had not noticed what was
forward.
