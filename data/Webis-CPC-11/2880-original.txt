She was not angry--that is, not altogether so--though the spirit she
showed was a pretty good imitation of anger, it must be confessed. She was peevish. Matters
had not gone right with her that day. She was crossed in this thing and that thing. Her new
hat had not come home from the milliner's, as she expected; one of her frocks had just got
badly torn; she had a hard lesson to learn; and I cannot repeat the whole catalogue of her
miseries. So she fretted, and stormed, and cried, and felt just as badly as she chose.

Not long after the crying spell was over, and there was a little blue sky in sight, Jeannette
Forrest, a cousin of Angeline's, came running into the room, her face all lighted up with smiles,
and threw her arms around her cousin's neck, and kissed her.
