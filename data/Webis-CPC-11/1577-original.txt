Importunity pays. Sooner or later you bought HIGLINSON's Blacking-cream.
You then found out that it was just about as good as any other, and went on buying it.

In one way this was very good for Mr. HIGLINSON, because he became very rich; in other ways
it was not so good for him. For a long time he had nothing to do with public life; the public
never thought about his existence; to the public he was not a man at all--he was only part
of the name of the stuff they used for their boots.
