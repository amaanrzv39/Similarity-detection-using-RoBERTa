Slovenliness is the aptest word to apply to the
workmanship of Maria (Hutchinson), the latest heroine of the Baroness Von Hutten. Maria has
the air of having been contracted for, while that fastidious overseer who lurks at the elbow
of every honest craftsman, condemning this or that phrase, readjusting the other faulty piece
of construction, has frankly abandoned the contractor. Maria was the daughter of an artist
cadger (name of Drello), friend of the great and seller of their autograph letters, whereby
he was astute enough to make a comfortable living. Maria had a dull brother named Laertes,
who accidentally met a highness, who fell very abruptly in love with Maria and made her strictly
dishonourable proposals.
