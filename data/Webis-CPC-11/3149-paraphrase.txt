And the littlest one said, "There's a human in my bed, let's poke with a stick it to see if it moves."

And Daddy Bear said, "I'll get my gun!"

And Mommy Bear said, "Just don't make a mess, dear."

And the little one said, "I'll get my stick!"

And Mommy Bear said, "Just be careful, it may have rabies."

But then, to the surprise of the Bear family, it moved!
Upon seeing the biggest bear with a gun and the littlest one with a stick, Golden Hair decided to make a fast getaway and jumped out the window.  Daddy Bear took aim, but she was too fast.  Little Bear threw his stick, but it hit a tree instead.  Mommy Bear stayed behind to make the bed.  They ran after her, but by now she had a good head start and she made it home before they caught her.
