When going in the visitor immediately sees a simply made bed which was ravaged by the Austrians.  There are portraits dotted around, one of which is a lively one of Voltaire aged 40 accompanied by silhouettes of the grand and good of the era.  There are also portraits of Lekain, Catharine and Frederick.

The partment window overlooks the gardens, beyond which can be seen a small wooded area.  This has all changed a great deal since Voltaire's time apart from the great row of elm trees.  Voltaire would wander through these at sunrise, meditating and reciting the scenes of his tragedies aloud to anyone he came across.
