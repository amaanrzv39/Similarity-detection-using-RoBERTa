Will we allow the descending pupils to remain in ignorance on these subjects: why the second city of New England was Providence; why for the rush for prosperity she deserted Newport in such a bad way; why Cincinnati and Buffalo were set up, all the while North Bend and Black Rock died down; why the biggest manufacturing city in North America became Chicago; why the town meeting was kept by New England, and the county and townships were preferred by the West; and why several upon several other things happened. For sure we have had Hildreth, Sparks, and Bancroft, but these people heve let us in on little of the historical facts of the people as Hallam, Hume, Lingard, as well as the others told England.
