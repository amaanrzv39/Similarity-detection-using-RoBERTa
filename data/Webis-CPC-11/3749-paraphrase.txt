Mac, having had difficulty settling in a place where the English had not occupied, advised me to first go to St Omer. We set off for Montreuil, which lay 60 miles from Calais after eating a small dinner. We were told we traveled en poste, but I feel sure we weren't moving more than four miles an hour at best. I was kept distracted though by what curious figures the postilions in their jack-boots seated atop their sad excuses for horses made. My companion and I were shaken about considerably by the time we had managed to travel the 15 miles to Marquise due to the poorly paved roads and the lack of springs in the chaises. We were brought to a poorly kept inn that looked more like a well kept pig-stye. After being shown our sparse and dirty room with it's two straw palets, the innkeep procured , with a great bit of difficulty, some relatively clean sheets at our request. The meager dinner they offered of roasted pidgeons were handed to us on dirty rags with a simple wooden handled knife for each of us. 
We set off the next day at dawn for Boulonge, agreeing that we would stop there to breakfast. Upon arriving however we found it to be overrun with English, which in retrospect was not surprising considering how inexpensive wine was in the area. We eat quickly and quietly before continuing on towards Montreuil. Once back on the road we passed through a vast and verdant country side planted with corn and trees at intervals, sometimes in enormous swaths that stretched for miles making for an enjoyable ride that day.
