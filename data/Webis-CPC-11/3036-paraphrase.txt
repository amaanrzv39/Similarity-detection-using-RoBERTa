Horace Bushnell was an academic, frequently authoring incredible papers on metaphysics and theology.  The park named for the man, however, will probably be his most famous legacy -- and it will most assuredly keep his name verdant and aromatic for all eternity.

This town is famous for its medical system (rightly so), its churches, and its priests. I don't think the parks could ever take precedence above the sanctity of church, even though it is said that there are "sermons in stones, and good in everything." But rest assured -- a walk through a blooming pasture, bordered by a babbling brook, is a far better cure for any malady than a day in bed or any other remedy that a doctor could concoct.

Everyone is prone to a little sadness -- businessmen, priets, and politicians are no exception.
