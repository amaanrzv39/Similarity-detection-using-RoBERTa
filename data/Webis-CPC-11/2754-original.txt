The green light pencils no longer streaked their paths of death in the direction of our world,
which now seemed so remote. The great ring with the vacant space in its rim wabbled uncertainly
for a moment as though some terrific upheaval from within was tearing it asunder. Then it lurched
directly for the Pioneer. We had been observed!

But Hart was equal to the occasion and he shot the Pioneer in the direction of the earth with
such acceleration that we all were flattened into our supports with the same old violence.
Then, with equal violence, we decelerated.
