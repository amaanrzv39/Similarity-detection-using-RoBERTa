I have previously talked about the summer-sleep of some tropical animals. The holes where the tortoises rest as the natives know, in the dry lands, in digging fifteen to eighteen inches in, the get out a great amount at one time. This process is dangerous, as noted by Father Gili, due to serpents being buried with the terekays throughout the summer.

We only spent nine days on the water, to Angostura, the capital of Guiana, from the island of Cucuruparu. The distance between the two is under ninety-five leagues. Rarely did we sleep on shore, however the cruelty of the mosquitos lessened as we went further. On the 8th of June we landed at a farm (Hato de San Rafail del Capuchino) across from the Rio Apure mouth.
