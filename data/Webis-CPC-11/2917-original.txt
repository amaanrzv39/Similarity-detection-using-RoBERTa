In this style he said to little Colonel
M'Mahon, the Prince's secretary--"I made him, and I shall unmake him."

The "fat friend" hit was more pungent in reality than in its usual form. The Prince, walking
down St James's Street with Lord Moira, and seeing Brummell approaching arm-in-arm with a man
of rank, determined to show the openness of the quarrel, stopped and spoke to the noble lord
with an apparent unconsciousness of ever having seen the Beau before. The moment he was turning
away, Brummell asked, in his most distinct voice, "Pray, who is your fat friend?" Nothing could
be more dexterously impudent; for it repaid the Prince's pretended want of recognition precisely
in his own coin, and besides stung him in the very spot where he was known to be most thin-skinned.
