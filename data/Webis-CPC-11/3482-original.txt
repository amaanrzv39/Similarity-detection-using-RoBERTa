I do not
thank you; I call you blessed. Greet the dear Princess, greet the small knot of my friends,
and tell them that you hope I shall do well. Soon you will hear more of me. Be happy and remember
me.

Yours,

RICHARD WAGNER

PARIS, June 5th, 1849

(Have you received the scores, and shall I see some of them here by-and-bye?)

I have been with your mother, and she has given me uncommon pleasure; she is a healthy woman!
I shall call on her again. She sends you best greetings.

DEAREST FRIEND,

It is nearly four weeks since my wife left me, and I have not yet had the least news of her.
My grief and depression are great. I must gain another home and hearth; otherwise all is over
with me. My heart is greater than my sense. With Belloni I have been in close consultation,
and we have formed the following opinion and the resolution derived therefrom:--

In Paris I can do no good at present; my business is to write an opera for Paris; for anything
else I am unfit. This object cannot be attained by storm; in the most favourable case I shall
achieve the poem in half a year, and the performance in a year and a half. In Paris without
a home, or--which is the same--peace of heart, I can do no work; I must find a new place where
I am at home and can make up my mind to remain at home. For such a place I have selected Zurich.
I have written to my wife to come there with her youngest sister, with the remnants of our
household goods, so as once more to be united to me.
