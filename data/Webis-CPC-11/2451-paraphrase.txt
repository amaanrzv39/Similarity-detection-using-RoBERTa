The Arizona Jay is indigenous to Southern New Mexico and Arizona, as well as into Sonora and Chihuahua, Mexico.  It is prevalant throughout the Oak Belt which reaches from the foothills of the mountains to the trees high up on the mountain.  With proper conditions, it thrives.  It is unusual to see it far from the dry plains.  After the breeding season is over, sometimes small flocks are found in the bushes near the few water sources that are found far away from their normal niche.
