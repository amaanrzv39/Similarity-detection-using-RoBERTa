Those who perform on the violin use the same notes as in our division, and they tune
the instrument by fifths to a great nicety. They are fond of playing the octave, but scarcely
use any other chord. The Sumatran tunes very much resemble, to my ear, those of the native
Irish, and have usually, like them, a flat third: the same has been observed of the music of
Bengal, and probably it will be found that the minor key obtains a preference amongst all people
at a certain stage of civilization.
