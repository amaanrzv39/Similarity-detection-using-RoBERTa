Am I always going to be like this? Will I always doubt your faithfulness? I will unless you change me and make me new. If that is the only way, God, change me, destroy my hard heart so that I won't be somebody who ruins your plans. 

Please, father, pray fervently that we can be completly covered in Christ's blood because that will make us mighty and loyal.
