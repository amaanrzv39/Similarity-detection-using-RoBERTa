Nor was This a single Inaccuracy in Sir George. I’ll instance in Two pretty Inscriptions, the
One an Epitaph, the other a Votive Table, which He has given Us, but in a very corrupt Condition.
Tho’ I have never been in Greece, nor seen the Inscriptions any where but in his Book, I think,
I can restore them to their true Sense and Numbers: And, as they are particularly elegant,
some Readers will not be displeas’d to see them in a State of Purity.
