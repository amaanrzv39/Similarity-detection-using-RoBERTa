Napoleon was occupied, I think, at Beresina:
he, however, had his Ossian with him. When did Thought lose the power of being able to leap
into the saddle behind Action? When did man forget to rush like Tyrtaeus to the combat, a sword
in one hand, the lyre in the other? Since the world still has a body, it has a soul."

Monsieur Charles Blanc writes: "In order to have an idea of the importance of the arts, it
is enough to fancy what the great nations of the world would be if the monuments they have
erected to their faiths, and the works whereon they have left the mark of their genius, were
suppressed from history. It is with people as with men--after death only the emanations of
their mind remain; that is to say, literature and art, written poems, and poems inscribed on
stone, in marble or in color."
