These effects
must indeed, in some way or other, be connected with the well-known arithmetical relations
between the rates of vibration of the sounds which form a musical scale. And it is possible--but
this is merely a suggestion--that the greater or less mechanical facility with which the vibrating
apparatus of the human larynx passes from one state of vibration to another, may have been
a primary cause of the greater or less pleasure produced by various sequences of sounds."
