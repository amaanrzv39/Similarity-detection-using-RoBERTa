MISQUOTATIONS.

Mr. Editor,--The offence of misquoting the poets is become so general, that I would suggest
to publishers the advantage of printing more copious indexes than those which are now offered
to the public. For the want of these, the newspapers sometimes make strange blunders. The Times,
for instance, has lately, more than once, given the following version of a well-known couplet:--

  "Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,
  As to be hated needs but to be seen."

The reader's memory will no doubt instantly substitute such hideous for "so frightful," and
that for "as."

The same paper, a short time since, made sad work with Moore, thus:--

  "You may break, you may ruin the vase if you will,
  But the scent of the roses will hang by it still."

Moore says nothing about the scents hanging by the vase. "Hanging" is an odious term, and destroys
the sentiment altogether. What Moore really does say is this:--

  "You may break, you may ruin the vase if you will,
  But the scent of the roses will cling round it still."

Now the couplet appears in its original beauty.

It is impossible to speak of the poets without thinking of Shakspeare, who towers above them
all. We have yet to discover an editor capable of doing him full justice. Some of Johnson's
notes are very amusing, and those of recent editors occasionally provoke a smile. If once a
blunder has been made it is persisted in.
