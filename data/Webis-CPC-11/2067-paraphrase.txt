He would decorate his home in beautiful smelling boughs, and while he cared for his children he would sing lively tunes of old Scotland. When the sun would set he would go to his home where he sang, read, prayed, and slept peacefully at night because it was the Lord who let him live so safely. Years later when he left the island he said " I was a better Christian in my solitude than ever before, or than I fear I shall ever be again."
