The other vessels comprise sailboats under 5 tons and rowboats. The sailboats are generally
small square-sterned sloops, open in the afterpart, but with a cuddy forward. They are all
built with centerboards, and some are lapstreak while others are "set work." Around the afterpart
of the standing room is a seat, the ballast is floored over, and two little bunks and a stove
generally help to furnish the cuddy. They vary in length from 16 to 26 feet and in width from
6 to 9 feet; they average about 2 tons.
