Gordon's mission, according to Earl
Granville, was a peaceful one, and he inquired anxiously what progress had been made in the
withdrawal of the Egyptian garrisons and civilians. This question he put, even in the teeth
of Gordon's positive statement in a telegram of March 8:--

If you do not send Zebehr, you have no chance of getting the garrisons away; . . . Zebehr here
would be far more powerful than the Mahdi, and he would make short work of the Mahdi[394].

[Footnote 394: Ibid. p. 145.]

A week earlier Gordon had closed a telegram with the despairing words:--

I will do my best to carry out my instructions, but I feel conviction I shall be caught in
Khartum[395].
