At life's origin, any present perception may have been
'true'--if such a word could then be applicable. Later, when reactions became organized, the
reactions became 'true' whenever expectation was fulfilled by them. Otherwise they were 'false'
or 'mistaken' reactions. But the same class of objects needs the same kind of reaction, so
the impulse to react consistently must gradually have been established, and a disappointment
felt whenever the results frustrated expectation. Here is a perfectly plausible germ for all
our higher consistencies. Nowadays, if an object claims from us a reaction of the kind habitually
accorded only to the opposite class of objects, our mental machinery refuses to run smoothly.
The situation is intellectually unsatisfactory.

Theoretic truth thus falls WITHIN the mind, being the accord of some
of its processes and objects with other processes and objects--
 'accord' consisting here in well-definable relations. So long as
the satisfaction of feeling such an accord is denied us, whatever
collateral profits may seem to inure from what we believe in are but
as dust in the balance--provided always that we are highly
organized intellectually, which the majority of us are not. The
amount of accord which satisfies most men and women is merely the
absence of violent clash between their usual thoughts and
statements and the limited sphere of sense-perceptions in which
their lives are cast.
