WIDE AWAKE. AN ILLUSTRATED MAGAZINE For the Young Folks. $2.00 PER ANNUM. POSTAGE PREPAID.
Edited by ELLA FARMAN. Published by D. LOTHROP & CO., Boston, Mass.

It always contains a feast of fat things for the little folks, and folks who are no longer
little find there lost childhood in its pages. We are not saying too much when we say that
its versatile editor--Ella Farman, is more fully at home in the child's wonder-land than any
other living American writer. She is thoroughly en rapport with her readers, gives them now
a sugar plum of poesy, now a dainty jelly-cake of imagination, and cunningly intermixes all
the solid bread of thought that the child's mind can digest and assimilate.--York True Democrat.
