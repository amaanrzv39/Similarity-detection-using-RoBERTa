is couered with the crust of the higher parts, and both with worse earth: your heights hauing
the crust taken away, are become meerely barren: so that either you must force a new crust,
or haue an euill soile. And be sure you leuell, before you plant, lest you be forced to remoue,
or hurt your plants by digging, and casting amongst their roots. Your ground must be cleered
as much as you may of stones, and grauell, walls, hedges, bushes, & other weeds.
