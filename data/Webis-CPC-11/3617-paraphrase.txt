Dryden may have educated at last from the study of Shakspeare, (in who, even so, he was well read more years before, as onlooker his Essay on Dramatic Poesy,) that "something farther might be attained in tragedy than the manifestation of magnified sentiment in flat verse." Is rhyme self-evidently unnatural in the manifestation, in verse, of tough and deep human passion? To that query, put hence broadly chatting, the right reply is--NO. And is it, then, likely unnatural in the drama?

Like all many might, that of rhyme is a surprise past finding out. In itself a simple barbarous jingle, it yet donates perfection to speech. The tunes of versification has endless kinds of evaluates, and rhyme hires enchantment to them all. Not an devotion, sensitivity, or passion of the soul that may not be soothed by its syllablings, enkindled, or lifted to rapture. Pity and terror, pleasure and anguish, love and devotion, are all alike wise of its influence; as the pleasant resemblances retain echoing through some artful injure, that all the while is reflected by them who perceive to draw close in ease from the unpremeditating heart. Songs, hymns, elegies, epicedia, epithalamia--rhyme statutes alike all the shadowy tribes. The triumphant ode--the penitential psalm--wisdom's significance lesson--the philosophic injure "that supports the ways of God to man;" such is the assortment of rhyme, down all the depths of the pathetic, up all the heights of the sublime. It is yet unlimited. Where will we find its bounds? Let us try.
