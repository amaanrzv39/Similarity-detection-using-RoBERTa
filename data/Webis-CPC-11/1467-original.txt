A single incident,
illustrating this trait in her character, is worth relating:--She went out early one morning
to visit a neighbour, promising to be at home to dinner. The neighbour being absent, she requested
to be shown into the library. There she became so absorbed in her book, standing, with her
bonnet unremoved, that the darkness of the coming night first reminded her she had forgotten
her meals, and expended the entire day in reading.

She was peculiarly sensitive to music.
