Godfrey was remarkable for his generosity and sumptuous entertainments. The king and queen,
with all their retinues, were provided for at the monastery, and once Prince Edward came with
Peter Gaveston, and the abbot presented them with two magnificent robes.[13]

Godfrey added many beautiful improvements to his monastery, and built "the great gate-tower,
over which was the chamber called the knights' chamber," being the gateway leading to the Bishop's
Palace. The walls of this room were carved with knights and their coats of arms.

Whilst Edward was preparing for war against Scotland, he sent five successive times to this
abbey for money to assist him in carrying on his enterprise, and Godfrey gave him in all about
Â£500.
