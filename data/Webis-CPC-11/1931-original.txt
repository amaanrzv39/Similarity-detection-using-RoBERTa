On the coin of Macrinus, the letter below the S.C. now clearly appears to be an [Greek: eta],
but the one above is not a [Greek: Delta], but rather an L or inverted T. It cannot stand for
[Greek: Lykabas], as on the Egyptian coinage, as Macrinus was slain by his soldiers the year
after his accession.

The Etruscilla, even under a powerful magnifier, betrays no trace of ever having been plated
and has all the marks by which numismatists determine the genuineness of a coin.
