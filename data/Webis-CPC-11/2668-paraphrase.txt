The registry law has much opposition. Without abandoning my own support of it, or similar laws, I am content in this message to urge you to attend to electoral reform, a matter of such import than none could dispute. When officers are chosen to receive and count ballots their conduct must be above suspicion. This can hardly be true when they are drawn each from the same political party. If we give fair representation to the minority it will do much to prevent fraud and also calm people's suspicions - which is at least as important.
