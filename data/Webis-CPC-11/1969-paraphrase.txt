In March 1825, a man named Frederick Hagedom Jr., from Libau, that's in Courland, came up with the idea for savings accounts in other European countries, and he figured this was better than the old way of doing things, hiding the stash, crossing your fingers and hoping for the best. He decided to start his own bank in Libau.
