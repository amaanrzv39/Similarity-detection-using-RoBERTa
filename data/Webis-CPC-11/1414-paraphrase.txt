The names of his publications, the dates of them, the number of them, the publisher's price for them, the critic's  feedback  of them, are pitiful facts for the biographer; and whether the man of genius be a man of quiet, sequestered life, the file of it shall  be alone  the many uninteresting towards the reader. It is alone when something painful has been suffered, something eccentric done and misunderstood and denounced or ridiculed,  that the biography  excites the languid interest of the public.
