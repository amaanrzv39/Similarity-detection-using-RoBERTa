The general criteria in a free trade environment follow this guideline:

The value of exchange shall be determined by the following rules:  1)Need or usefulness of the product, 2)How difficult is the product to get, and 3)How difficult is the product to ship from it's present location.

With respect to the need or usefulness of the product, there are three categories: 1.Limited supplies, such as art and items not available from multiple sources.  2)Items which are raw materials for other products which require added labor and funding.  3)Items which have the potential for costs to be inflated in the future.
