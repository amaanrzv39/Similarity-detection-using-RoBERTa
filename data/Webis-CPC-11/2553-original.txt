What Port Said is now, San Francisco was then, only worse. For every
crime that is committed in the dark alleys of the Suez port or the equally murky callejons
of the pestholes of Mexico, four were committed in the beautiful Californian town when I first
went there. Women as well as men carried "hardware" strapped outside, and scarcely one who
had not at some time found this precaution useful. The city abounded with footpads and ruffians
of every nationality and description, whose prices for cutting a throat or "rolling a stiff"
depended on the cupidity of the moment or on the quantity of liquor their capacious stomachs
held. Scores of killings occurred and excited little comment.
