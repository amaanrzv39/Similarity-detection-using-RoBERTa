He observes, that although a workman
would be amazed on hearing a proposition to pierce calcareous stone with the shell of a Pholas,
yet he himself has done it, and holds the success to be a proof that the animal can do the
same. The idea of the acid might be accepted, while it was proved that the creatures were to
be found only in limestone; but now that he has sent to the Acad√©mie specimens of gneiss and
mica schist, containing pholades, on which the acid has no effect, he conceives that they must
have entered by boring. They have also been found in porphyry--a fact of which Brongniart said,
many years ago, that nature had concealed the explanation, and we must wait for a solution.
