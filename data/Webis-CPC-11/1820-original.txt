It must be recollected, that this order was issued and executed on the last day of February,
six weeks after the Charleston Gazette had announced at New-Orleans, the ratification of the
treaty of peace, as above stated. During all this period, there had not been an appearance
of the enemy, or a movement by them, or the slightest occurrence or rumour, to raise a doubt
of the truth of this intelligence. Not a doubt of it was expressed by any body or from any
quarter.
