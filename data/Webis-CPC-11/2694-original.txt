It is probable that Rembrandt used a number of etching needles
of different widths. We do not see the typical changes in the lines produced by stopping-out
or re-etching. Re-etching of new lines crossing previously etched lines often causes a slight
penetration of acid under the ground into the old lines. This shows in the printing as a dark
spot at the point of crossing. Such an effect is not found in this print. A similar result
in the cross-hatching at the lower left is caused instead by drypoint lines crossing etched lines.

No direct evidence has been found concerning the acid corrosive used by Rembrandt to bite his
plate.[28] Only tentative conclusions can be drawn from this and other prints.
