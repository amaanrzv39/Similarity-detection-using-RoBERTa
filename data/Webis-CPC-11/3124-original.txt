The suggestions for illustrations in the later books were incomplete,
and did not indicate, in all cases, with sufficient definiteness to allow them to be executed,
the changes from conventional plans and designs intended by the translator. It has, therefore,
been decided to include in this part of the work only those illustrations which are known to
have had the full approval of Professor Morgan. The one exception to this principle is the
reproduction of a rough model of the Ram of Hegetor, constructed by me on the basis of the
measurements given by Vitruvius and Athenaeus.

It does not seem to me necessary or even advisable to enter into a long discussion as to the
date of Vitruvius, which has been assigned to various periods from the time of Augustus to
the early centuries of our era.
