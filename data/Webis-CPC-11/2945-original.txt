It appears, however, that Madame de Tencin, as well as the whole fashionable world to which
she belonged, could never altogether disavow their contempt for science, if indeed it be true,
that she was accustomed to call her society by the indecent by-name of her m√©nagerie. Fontenelle,
Montesquieu, Mairan, Helvetius who was then quite young and present rather as a hearer than
a speaker, Marivaux and Astruc, formed the nucleus of this clever society and led the conversation.
Marmontel, who was not well suited to this society, in which more real knowledge and a deeper
train of thought was called for than he possessed, informs us what the tone of this society
was, and speaks of their hunting after lively conceits and brilliant flashes of wit, in a somewhat
contemptuous manner.
