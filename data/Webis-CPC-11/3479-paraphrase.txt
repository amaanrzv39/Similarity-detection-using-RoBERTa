It is not alone fit to exercise the bookish commonsense of a abundant people, and to accord thereby to the accomplishment of mankind, but it is aswell basal to all workmen, whose end is to accord to assertive bodies bent forms, and it is principally attributable to the methods of this art accepting been too little extended, or in actuality about actually neglected, that the advance of our industry has been so slow. We shall accord again to accord an advantageous administration to civic education, by authoritative our adolescent artisan accustomed with the appliance of anecdotic geometry, to the clear constructions which are all-important in the greater amount of the arts, and in authoritative use of this geometry in the representation and assurance of the elements of machinery, by agency of which, man by the aid of the armament of nature, affluence for himself, in a manner, in his operations no added labour than that of his intellects. It is no beneath advantageous to extend the ability of those phenomena of attributes which may be angry to the accumulation of the arts. The agreeableness which accompanies them will affected the abhorrence that men accept in accepted for chiral operations, (which a lot of attention as aching and laborious,) as it will accomplish them acquisition amusement in the exercise of their intellect; appropriately there care to be in the academic academy a advance of anecdotic geometry.

As yet we accept no able-bodied aggregate elementary plan on that art, because till this time abstruse men accept taken too little absorption in it, or it has alone been practised in an abstruse address by bodies whose apprenticeship had not been abundantly extended, and were clumsy to acquaint the aftereffect of their lucubrations. A advance artlessly articulate would be actually after effect.
