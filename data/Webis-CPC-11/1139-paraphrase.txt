A Free Martin:
My Jersey cow has just given birth to twin calves, a bull, and a heifer. The heifer seems to be the strongest and was also born about five minutes before the bull. My neighbors have been telling me to fatten both and send them to the butcher, their logic being that the heifer is going to be barren.
