Is there any clew given to the reader that it
is a magic tempest? What is Prospero's main object in having the ship's crew and passengers
cast upon his island? Is it to wreak vengeance on his enemies, to work the charm of love between
Ferdinand and Miranda, or by means of that to reinstate himself? In what way would this love
work to his advantage? Notice the natural way in which the reader is put in possession of the
necessary information about the past of Prospero and Miranda.
