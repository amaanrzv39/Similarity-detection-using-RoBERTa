One other distingushed French author who he wanted to become aquainted with was Victor Hugo,I was told that he carried a letter of introduction with him from Lord Houghton hoping for the time to give it. This never happened though,in 1866 Mr. Browning went to Saint Malo and spent several days in Jersey.

During this winter in paris he met M. Joseph Milsand who he was united by close friendship and caring.
