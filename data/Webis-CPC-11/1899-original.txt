It will be found to be one
of the most amusing books of the day, and also not without a moral of its own kind. We presume
it is of no use to debate how far it is allowable to bring before the public matters pertaining
to private life, and about which living individuals may feel a delicacy. The time for such
questions seems past. Assuming so much, we at least feel pretty sure that the lives and characters
of living men could scarcely be in gentler or more genial hands than those of William Jerdan.
