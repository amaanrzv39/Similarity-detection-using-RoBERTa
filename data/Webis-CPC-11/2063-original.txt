Mr. Cox, indeed, would have us believe that the whole
notion arose from an unintentional play upon words; but the careful survey of the field, which
has been taken by Hertz and Baring-Gould, leads to the conclusion that many other circumstances
have been at work. The delusion, though doubtless purely mythical in its origin, nevertheless
presents in its developed state a curious mixture of mythical and historical elements.

With regard to the Arkadian legend, taken by itself, Mr. Cox is probably right.
