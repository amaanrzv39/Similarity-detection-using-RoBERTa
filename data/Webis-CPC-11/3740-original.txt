She approached the window, and, for an instant--oh how brief!--looked into the
heavenly night. My poor heart sickened with delight, and I strained my eyes long after all
was blank and dark again.

Daylight, and the employments of day, if they did not remove, weakened the turbulence of the
preceding night. The more I found my passion acquiring mastery, with greater vigour I renewed
my work, and with more determination I pursued the objects that were most likely to fight and
overcome it. I laboured with the youths for a longer period. I undertook to prepare a composition
for the following day which I knew must take much thought and many hours in working out. I
armed myself at all points--but the evening came and found me once more conscious of a void
that left me prostrate. Mr Fairman was again absent from home. I could not rest in it, and
I too sallied forth, but this time, to the village. I would not deliberately offer violence
to my conscience, and I shrunk from a premeditated visit to the distant house. My own acquaintances
in the village were not many, or of long standing, but there were some half dozen, especial
favourites of the incumbent's daughter. To one of these I bent my steps, with no other purpose
than that of baffling time that hung upon me painfully and heavily at home. For a few minutes
I spoke with the aged female of the house on general topics; then a passing observation--in
spite of me--escaped my lips in reference to Miss Ellen. The villager took up the theme and
expatiated widely.
