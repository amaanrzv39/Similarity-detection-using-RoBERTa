Colebe's wife brought her child to Governor Phillip's house a few days after it
was born, and as it was a female, both the father and mother had been repeatedly told, that
if the finger was to be cut off, the governor wished to see the operation. The child was now
two months old, and a ligature was applied round the little finger at the second joint; but
two or three days afterwards, when she brought the child again, the ligature was either broke,
or had been taken off: this being mentioned to the mother, she took several hairs from the
head of an officer who was present, and bound them very tight round the child's finger. After
some time, a gangrene took place; and though the child appeared uneasy when the finger was
touched, it did not cry, nor was any attention paid to it after the ligature was applied.
