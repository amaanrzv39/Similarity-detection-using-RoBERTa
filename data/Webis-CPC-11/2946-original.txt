The faith and prayers which may be necessary
to bring their children into the fold of the Good Shepherd, who in his last commission to his
disciples did not forget to remind them, saying, "Feed my lambs," and whose promise and prediction,
before his coming into the world, was, "Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings I have ordained
praise." The Scriptures inform us that it was the purpose of God when he "set the solitary
in families," to "seek a goodly seed."

How delightful and consoling then is the thought, in this world of sin and temptation, where
there are three mighty obstacles to the final salvation of our children--the world, the flesh
and the devil, that angels, ministering spirits, are appointed to "keep their watchful stations"
around the families of the just.
