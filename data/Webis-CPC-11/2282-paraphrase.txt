Arthur, as befits a king, decreed a settlement to the claim both men had on the maiden.  Gwyn ap Nudd of the North and Gwythyr son of Griedawl would enter into battle annually on May first and fight for the hand of the maiden from that day forward until one of them should die .  The maiden would in the meanwhile live with her father and see neither of her suitors.  As a gesture of peace between the houses of the two suitors, Arthur released the nobles from prison.
