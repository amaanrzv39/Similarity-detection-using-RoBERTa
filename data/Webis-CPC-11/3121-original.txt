The fire-flies darted in the depths of vineyards
and of trees below; then the noise of the grasshoppers brought back suddenly the gardens of
home, and whatever benediction surrounds our childhood. Some promise of eternal pleasures and
of rest deserved haunted the village of Sillano.

In very early youth the soul can still remember its immortal habitation, and clouds and the
edges of hills are of another kind from ours, and every scent and colour has a savour of Paradise.
What that quality may be no language can tell, nor have men made any words, no, nor any music,
to recall it--only in a transient way and elusive the recollection of what youth was, and purity,
flashes on us in phrases of the poets, and is gone before we can fix it in our minds--oh! my
friends, if we could but recall it!
