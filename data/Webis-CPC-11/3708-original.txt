I have sinned; I can hardly hope to be forgiven, but I have now told
the sacred truth.'

All this was uttered by the repentant woman, but at the time it was almost wholly unheard by
those most interested in the statement. They only comprehended that they were saved--that the
child was theirs in very truth. Great, abundant, but for the moment, bewildering joy! Mr Arbuthnot--his
beautiful young wife--her own true boy (how could she for a moment have doubted that he was
her own true boy!--you might read that thought through all her tears, thickly as they fell)--the
aged and half-stunned rector, whilst yet Mrs Danby was speaking, were exclaiming, sobbing in
each other's arms, ay, and praising God too, with broken voices and incoherent words it may
be, but certainly with fervent, pious, grateful hearts.

When we had time to look about us, it was found that the felon had disappeared--escaped. It
was well, perhaps, that he had; better, that he has not been heard of since.

THE TAXES ON KNOWLEDGE.

To all appearance, the abolition of the taxes on the spread of knowledge through the press
is only a matter of time. The principal of these taxes is the Excise-duty on paper, which,
as we have repeatedly urged, acts most detrimentally on the issue of a cheap class of publications.
The duty next in importance is that which is charged on advertisements. Our belief is, that
a relief from this taxation would be a prodigious advantage to all departments of trade and
commerce, as well as to various social interests.
