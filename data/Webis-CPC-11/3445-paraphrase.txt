Missus, when dat gemman 'peared at my do, I thort dat he was a specalader, an' dat you was gwine to sell me." "No, Aunt Barbara," said Mrs. Ridley, "if all the money of all the negro buyers were added together, it would not make an amount sufficient to buy you. Nothing but death can seperate us. You are a part of my very existence. I have left in my bosom a spark of gratitude yet, which kindles into a flame when I remember what you have done for the family. I have not forgotten that it was you that gave the timely warning of the approach of Nat Turner and his column. By so doing you probaly saved the lives of the household. On another occasion you saved the life of my darling babe by a miracle wrought in your own way. Aunt Barbara, I would not give you and your nostrums, such as 'Cider Berry Juice,' 'Sweet Flag,' 'Taters''Sugar Rags' and 'Black Jack' for all the doctors in Christendom." "Missus, I'm glad dat you tink so much ob me. I has always done de bes dat I could. You know dat de chillun on de plantashun was bad, but wid my Black Jack I always made dem have deyself." "That is very true, Aunt Barbara, and they all love you for it. You know, Aunt Barbara, that the Good Book tells us, 'spare the rod you spoil your child." "Missus, dats what i 'luded to all de time. I nebber struc' one ob dem little niggers a lic' amiss in my life, unless i struc' at himd and didn't toch him." The old woman here saw a little nigger coming at full tilt, and knew something was wrong. When he came up, she asked: "What on earth is de matter?" The boy was quite out of breath and couldn't speak at the time. The old woman gave him a rake with Black Jack and said: "What is de matter wid you?"
