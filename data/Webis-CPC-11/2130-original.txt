In 833, a parliament was held at London, in the presence of King Egbert, with his son Ethelwolf,
and Withlaf, the tributary King of Mercia, and most of the prelates and great men of the realm,
to deliberate on the best means they could adopt to prevent the Danes from invading England.

In 1210, King John summoned a parliament to meet him at his palace in St. Bride's parish, London;
where he exacted of the clergy and religious persons the sum of 100,000l., and 40,000l. in
particular from the white monks.
