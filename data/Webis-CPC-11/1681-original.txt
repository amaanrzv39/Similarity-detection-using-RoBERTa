When the managing partner is herself married, the sphere of her exertions widens, and her perfect
unselfishness becomes more and more apparent. She directs the affairs of her husband, of her
friends, of her neighbours--everybody's affairs, in short, but her own. She has the most uncomfortable
house, the most uncared-for children, the most untidy person in the parish: but how could it
be otherwise, since all her thoughts and cares are given to her neighbours?
