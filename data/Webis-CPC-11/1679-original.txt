Above this junction the Thames nowadays is hardly a stream;
and even in the eighteenth century and earlier, before the digging of the Severn and Thames
Canal, it must have depended on the weather whether there were any appreciable amount of water
in the upper part or not. It would probably be found, if records could be examined, that the
mills at Somerford Keynes were not continually worked throughout the year, even when the supply
of water had been left undiminished by modern engineering.
