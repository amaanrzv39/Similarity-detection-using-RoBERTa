"I've made up my mind. I'm not having a birthday this year!"

"You can't stop a birthday, you know."

"Yes I can!" I said angrily. "It's mine, and if I decide I don't want to have a birthday this year, nobody can make me do it, not even you!"

"There you go, acting selfish again."

"It's not selfish! If I want to deprive myself of a birthday, nobody's going to stop me!"
