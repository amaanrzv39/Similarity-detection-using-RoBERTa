It also often happened that, owing to the sudden illness or death of the owner, the
place of concealment was unknown to any one; thus the savings were lost, and much family trouble
and difficulty arose. In March 1825, a truly patriotic young merchant, Frederick Hagedom, junior,
of Libau, in Courland, perceived the advantage of savings-banks in other countries of Europe,
and the disadvantages of the system pursued by his poor countrymen. He resolved, therefore,
to institute a savings-bank in Libau.
