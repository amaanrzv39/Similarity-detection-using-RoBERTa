19 Dec New version goes live!!
After months of Beta testing, the new version of Floorplanner is finally here! In the past months we have done a lot of listening, designing, tweaking, discussing, testing and coding to make it happen. Now that it is finally live, we'd like to introduce you to the new version of Floorplanner and cover some of the common questions.
What's new?
The most visible changes are of course the new interface and the improved 3D. But we have also made some big changes to the PRO and Business subscriptions, added a new Enterprise version (for retailers) made lots of 2D improvements, completely rewritten the backend for better worldwide speed and reliability, integrated a translation system that can be maintained by local users, moved to the "cloud" for storage and content distribution, improved and extended our API's, built a better integration of Flash and HTML content and done many more things. Some of you followed the progress through Twitter or our Tech-blog nterface
The look and feel of the site and interface was due to a serious make-over. Richard and Rob redesigned most pages and combined with Tummie's" illustrations gave the site a fresh new look. Usability has been improved on various fronts. For instance, logged in users can now access their plans on the dashboard page by clicking on the preview. The sidebar in your work-area can now be minimized for maximum working space. New interfaceSome final words
We're excited to release the new Floorplanner as we think you'll like the new features and improved 3D capabilities. A big thanks to all users who have provided us with thousands of valuable comments and suggestions during the Beta. Also a special thanks the growing group of translators who are helping us making floorplanner available in many more languages.
With this new version we have a good base to build on and already have many new features planned for 2009.
