There is much opposition to the enactment of a registry law.
     Without yielding my own settled convictions in favor of such a law,
     I content myself, in this communication, with urging upon your
     attention a measure of reform in the manner of conducting
     elections, the importance and justice of which no one ventures to
     deny. The conduct of the officers whose duty at elections it is to
     receive and count the ballots, and to make returns of the result,
     ought to be above suspicion. This can rarely be the case where they
     all belong to the same political party. A fair representation of
     the minority will go far, not only to prevent fraud, but, what is
     almost of equal importance, remove the suspicion of fraud.
