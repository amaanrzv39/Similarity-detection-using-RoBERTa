It would probably be safe to say that not more than one joint in fifty, attacked by rheumatism,
is left in any way permanently the worse.

But, alas! to counterbalance this mercifulness in the matter of permanent damage, unlike most
other infections, one attack of rheumatic fever, so far from protecting against another, renders
both the individual and the joint more liable to other attacks. The historic motto of the British
in the War of 1812 might be paraphrased into, "Once rheumatic, always rheumatic."
