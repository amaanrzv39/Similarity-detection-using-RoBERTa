These can be planted in October and, later, in January for succession.  When they are planted in October they are to be protected by a layer of leaves or short stable litter.  Expect them to flower in May and June.  Once the leaves have ripened they should be stored in a dry room until planting time arrives.  Easily raised from the seed, a bed of the single varieties is  wonderful for flower gardens.  In a warm scenario they contribute a lot of beautiful, spectacular flowers.  This can occur just about as soon as the snowdrop or crocus.
