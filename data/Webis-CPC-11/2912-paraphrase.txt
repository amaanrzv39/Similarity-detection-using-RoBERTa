(By the own Prophet of Punch)

It is only justified if I should extend the readers of this journal the benefit of my advice and opinions, since various events are approaching.  The Paleolithic cauliflower-headed dispensers of buncombe and bombast would sit up and curse the day on which fate allowed them to be born, when in good time I shall have something to say about Goodwood. There are some who agree to attach importance to the goose-billed mouthings and vapourings of the butter-brained crew who follow in the wake of the most notorious professor of humbugging pomposity that even this age, rich as it is in putty-faced impostors, has ever produced. Allow them, for good. The advice to the beautiful Marquise DE CENTAMOURS by the French King to the beautiful, which I will follow on my part.
