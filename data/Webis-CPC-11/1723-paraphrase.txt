I have discovered a poem that Napoleon wrote about Corica when he was young.  Although some parts still remain preserved in "Les Annales de l'Europe," for the most part, Napoleon attempted to destroy every copy of the poem that existed and frequently bought copies for the sole reason of destroying them.  In fact, there is likely not a single copy that exists today.
