Instruction shall be limited to University members only who report directly to the "Grand Master".  Therefore each instructor, tutor, and administrator must be sanctioned by the University.  Additionally, the University oversees every facet of the satellite institution, whether it be parochial or secular.  This manipulation is not limited to acceptance of the instructors, but also the curriculum and the extra-curricular activities, with an enforced conformity which in essence, makes the satellite schools cloned offspring of the parent school with no room for individuality or improvisation.
