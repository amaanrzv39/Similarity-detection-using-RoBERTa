Then
as human nature is true, and as the Bible's revelation is exactly fitted to it, the inevitable

WHERE SHALL WE TAKE INFIDELS TO GET THEM OUT OF UNBELIEF?

Goethe says it is a law of the demons that they must get out at the same place where they sneaked
in. This is a very suggestive expression. If a mathematician makes a mistake in the solution
of a problem his only chance to get out of the difficulty lies just at the point where the
mistake was made. He must remain in perplexity until he finds the mistake and corrects it.
This law holds good in all our intellectual operations. Many men are professedly in unbelief.
How shall we get them out?
