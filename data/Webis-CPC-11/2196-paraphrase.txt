My sole answer to the work written anonymously by the author known as M. Laplace, who knew all about geometry but nothing about France and therefore gave Bailly the bad advice, will be these small details.

It's sad that this writer should write with authority talking badly about someone so illustrious when he didn't know the real facts.
