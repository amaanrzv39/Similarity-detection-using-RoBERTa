With
Goldsmith it is somewhat different.  In The Vicar of Wakefield he seeks simply to please his
readers, and desires not to prove a theory; he looks on life rather as a picture to be painted
than as a problem to be solved; his aim is to create men and women more than to vivisect them;
his dialogue is essentially dramatic, and his novel seems to pass naturally into the dramatic
form.  And to me there is something very pleasurable in seeing and studying the same subject
under different conditions of art.
