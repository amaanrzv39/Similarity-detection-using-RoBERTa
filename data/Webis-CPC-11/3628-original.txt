On the one side, with ear close to the grate, is a round, smoothly developed Italian head,
with that rather tumid outline of features which one often sees in a Roman in middle life,
when easy living and habits of sensual indulgence begin to reveal their signs in the countenance,
and to broaden and confuse the clear-cut, statuesque lines of early youth. Evidently, that
is the head of an easy-going, pleasure-loving man, who has waxed warm with good living, and
performs the duties of his office with an unctuous grace as something becoming and decorous
to be gone through with. Evidently, he is puzzled and half-contemptuous at the revelations
which come through the grating in hoarse whispers from those thin, trembling lips. That other
man, who speaks with the sweat of anguish beaded on his brow, with a mortal pallor on his thin,
worn cheeks, is putting questions to the celestial guide within which seem to that guide the
ravings of a crazed lunatic; and yet there is a deadly, despairing earnestness in the appeal
that makes an indistinct knocking at the door of his heart, for the man is born of woman, and
can feel that somehow or other these are the words of a mighty agony.

He addresses him some words of commonplace ghostly comfort, and gives a plenary absolution.
The Capuchin monk rises up and stands meekly wiping the sweat from his brow, the churchman
leaves his box, and they meet face to face, when each starts, seeing in the other the apparition
of a once well-known countenance.
