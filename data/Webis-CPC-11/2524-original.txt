In this fashion young Raoul Chamblard talked while comfortably settled back in a large red
velvet arm-chair. This happened on the 26th of March, 1892, in one of the parlor-cars of the
express to Marseilles, which had left Paris at 8.50 that morning. It was now five minutes past
nine. The train with much racket was crossing the bridge of Charentin. Young Chamblard was
talking to his friend, Maurice RÃ©voille, who, after a six weeks' leave, was going to join his
regiment in Algeria.

The lieutenant of light cavalry responded to his friend's question with a vague gesture. Raoul
Chamblard continued:

"However, it's my father's fixed idea. There must be Chamblards after me. And as papa has but
one son, it's to me he looks to do what is necessary."
