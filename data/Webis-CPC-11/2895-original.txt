But the Western Shore
could not endure that the educational success of its rival section of the State should so far
outstrip its own. In the early days of the State, the sections were nearly equal in importance
and the prevailing dualism of the political system invaded the field of education.

In 1784, two years after the founding of Washington College, St. John's College was chartered.[7]
It was to be placed at Annapolis, and in it was merged the old county Academy, "King William's
School," founded some eighty years before. By the same act, the two colleges were united in
the University of Maryland. This University was modeled on the English type: the governor was
to be its chancellor, and the governing body was to be the "Convocation of the University of
Maryland."
