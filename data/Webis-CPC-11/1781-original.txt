Both those wills so fully arrange for the security of the property
in possession or reversion that I have now only to appoint and constitute my beloved brother
John Smyth, Esq., my only executor for his life; and I do by this deed place the utmost confidence
in my brother that he will at any future time do my son justice. And I also entreat my son
to cause the remains of his mother to be removed to Ashton, and buried in the family vault
close to my side, and to raise a monument to her memory.
