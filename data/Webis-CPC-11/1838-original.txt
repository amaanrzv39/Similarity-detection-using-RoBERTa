His father was Sir Winston Churchill, a gallant cavalier who
had drawn his sword in behalf of Charles I., and had in consequence been deprived of his fortune
and driven into exile by Cromwell. His paternal family was very ancient, and boasted its descent
from the Courcils de Poitou, who came into England with the Conqueror. His mother was Elizabeth
Drake, who claimed a collateral connexion with the descendants of the illustrious Sir Francis
Drake, the great navigator.
