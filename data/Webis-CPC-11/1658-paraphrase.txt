The majority of the soliers were grouped together in a queue and didn't shoot their guns.  A smaller group bringing up the rear inevitably ran in to the naval vessels commanded by Lord Cochrane as they arrived at Cape Kolias.  In the Eastern barracks of the Priaeus, there were nearly a thousand men here and there, that weren't interested in turning the Turkish troops' attention away from the battalion.  General Gueheneuc of France and General Heideck of Bavaria saw the epic conflict and reported on it.
