I am going to take a single quote from this selection, after which we will be done with M. Comte.  By looking at the the progress man has made theologicall, he illustrates three different periods: Fetishism, Polytheism, and Monotheism.  We will be focusing mainly on the first of these, Fetishism.  In this stage of idolatry, only things were worshipped, humans transferred some power to these things.
