When the princess was fourteen, her husband died, deserting her heir towards his kingdom. A parliament was convened, and the young queen was crowned with great solemnity. Then emerged a committee of lords and commons, petitioning her towards allow them towards seek a number of grand knight or prince towards  marry her and defend the kingdom. Now Catherine had secretly  decided not towards marry, but she resolved with a wisdom not  knowledgeable altogether from books. She accepted marry  whether they would  fetch her a bridegroom possessing certain qualifications which she knew were impossible towards fulfil. This silenced the counsellors, and she persisted towards reign alone.

In the course of moment Queen Catherine became a Christian and devoted herself towards works of religion and charity. Under her lecturing a lot of her civilians were converted towards the faith. It was a glad kingdom until the Emperor Maxentius chanced towards trip the royal city. He was a tyrant whom persecuted Christians. Upon his arrival he commissioned social sacrifices towards idols, and everybody whom would not collaborate within the heathen ceremony were slain. Then Catherine went boldly towards greet the emperor and predetermined forth towards him the errors of paganism. Though confounded via her eloquence he was not towards be convinced via the vocabulary of a mere woman. Accordingly he paged from divers provinces fifty masters "which surmounted everybody mortal men within worldly wisdom." They were towards hold a debate with the queen and put her towards confusion. For everybody their arguments, however, Catherine had an answer. So finalise was her victory that the entire corporate declared themselves Christians. The angry emperor inflicted them everybody towards be burned and cast Catherine into prison.

Even here she persisted her nice works, converting the empress and a prince whom arrived towards trip her.
