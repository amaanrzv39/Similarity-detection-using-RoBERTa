The Abb√© thence justly concludes, that the ambassador could not have been a Jew; and it is
extraordinary that Daru, after such a conclusive argument, should have admitted the term Jew
into his text. But the truth is, that this writer (like many others of great reputation) preferred
blindly following the text of Sanuto, as printed by Muratori[2], to the trouble of consulting
any early manuscripts. It happens, however, that in a manuscript copy of these Orations of
Mocenigo, written certainly earlier than the period of Sanuto, and preserved in the British
Museum, MS. Add. 12, 121., the true reading of the passage may be found thus:--"Fo mandato
Bartolomio Valori, homo richo, el qual viveva de cambij."
