There is that greed in the soul to pass through worlds
and ages,--through growths, griefs, desires, processes, spheres,--to travel the endless highways,--to
pass and resume again. O Heavens, you are but a splendid fable of the elder mind! Centripetal
and centrifugal are in man, too, and primarily; and an aspiring soul will ascend into the sweeps
and circles, and pass swift and devouring through baffling intervals and steep-down strata
of galaxies and stars.
