Her horse named Jack had lost the ornaments of mane and tail, his head, one fore and one hind leg. It was perched upon a stand with wheels. the horse was a faithful aniamal, he was very honest and faithful, he did all works at the best.I am always play with Jack and go round with the kitchen till the mistress satisfied.

My enfeebled frame was become worse because of the baby's rough treatment.
