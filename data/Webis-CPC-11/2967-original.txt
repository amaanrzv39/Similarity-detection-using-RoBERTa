One is a musing, subjective method of delineation, in which the various shades and windings
seem to reveal themselves with a certain spontaneity, and we follow many recesses and depths
in the heart of another, such as only music stirs into consciousness in ourselves. Besides
this rarer poetic method, there is what may be styled the diplomatist's method; it classifies
characters objectively, according to the kinds of outer conduct in which they manifest themselves,
and according to the best ways of approaching and dealing with them. The second of these describes
the spirit in which Vauvenargues observed men. He is French, and not German, and belongs to
the eighteenth century, and not to the seventeenth or the nineteenth.
