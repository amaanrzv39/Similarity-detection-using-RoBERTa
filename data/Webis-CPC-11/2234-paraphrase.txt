These birds didn't understand their human neighbors.  They'd flown south for the winter and were returning, from Costa Rica, or perhaps they had sought to summer in someplace with fewer humans.

But the myrtle warblers don't seem to mind human company, though I haven't asked my counterpart.  They are native to wild and empty places, but for some reason they really like to nest right next to houses.  Especially in the roof gutters, fireplace flues, and occasionally against the window panes.
