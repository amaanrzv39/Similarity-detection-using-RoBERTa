When a stranger walks around a country grave yard he will cast his eyes over the brief epitaphs on the tomb stones. Brief chronicles of the lives lived of dutiful wives, tender husbands, loving children and other endearing descriptive reminders of persons of all classes and creeds are all enscripted on the grave stones. 
The stranger will be tempted to exclaim in bemusement and in the language of a character of a modern story, who has found themselves in a simalar predicament, "Where are all the bad people buried?"
He will not speak the answer, but may smile to himself instead, and may regret that the obvious answer has intruded upon him so soon.
