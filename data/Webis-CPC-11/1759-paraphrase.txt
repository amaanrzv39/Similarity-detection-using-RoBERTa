In the Gardeners' Chronicle for September 25, of that year, page 398, it is said that the boxwood forests of Mingrelia in the Caucasian range were almost worn out. Old forests, long deserted, were even then explored in search of trees that might have escaped the notice of former proprietors, and wood that was discarded by them was, in 1875, eagerly purchased at high prices for England. The export of wood was at that time banned from Abhasia and all the government forests in the Caucasus.
