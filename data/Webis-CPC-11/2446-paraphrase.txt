For example, if I die and my young children remain on earth, do I recognize these children in my consciousness in Devachan as children?  Or, rather, will I see them as dying when I had died?  Or, even still, will I see them as adults, without a past?  Or, will they be absent from Devachan, until they do die, and then will appear to me to explain their entire life stories?

It is impossible for us to understand, at this time, the memories that remain at various parts of a soul's journey.
