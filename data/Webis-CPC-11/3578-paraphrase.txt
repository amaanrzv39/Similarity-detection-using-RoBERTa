He possesses a powerful arm, which had very important freedom when applied to the deep birch boot room. I must admit that my interview with Father St. John in the boot room were not uncommon. But, after all, the immediate effect soon died, and the incident was forgotten. However, to my surprise, when the school accounts were provided at the end, my father was puzzled over an item, namely, "birch - Â£ 1 2s 6d .." (The rate of half a crown each)! He asked me what it meant, and I explained it as best I could dear father of St. John was truly a responsible person in, and I had no doubt my father would get a full explanation from him, whether he wrote. But it brought home to me the memory of nine visits to the boot room with friendly and much-respected father of St. John. The last few months I have met again, after my long absence in other countries, several of my school mates. They are all going strong and well, holding high positions in the world, and as committed as ever to the old school at Edgbaston. One is now Viscount Fitzalan, Viceroy of Ireland.

When the two older brothers left the Oratory, which I could say was a school where boys were allowed very considerable freedom, my father must have thought, no doubt, when recalling 10:06 p.m. pence for birch, it would be wise to send me somewhere where the rules of college were in his opinion, somewhat more stringent.
