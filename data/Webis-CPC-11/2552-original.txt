It is vnspeakeable, what fatnesse is brought to low grounds by inundations of waters. Neither
did I euer know any barren ground in a low plaine by a Riuer side. The goodnesse of the soile
in Howle or Hollowdernes, in York-shire, is well knowne to all that know the Riuer Humber,
and the huge bulkes of their Cattell there. By estimation of them that haue seene the low grounds
in Holland and Zealand they farre surpasse the most Countries in Europe for fruitfulnesse,
and only because they lie so low. The world cannot compare with Ã†gypt, for fertility, so farre
as Nilus doth ouer flow his bankes. So that a fitter place cannot be chosen for an Orchard,
then a low plaine by a riuer side.
