Suppose, then, light-waves, or heat-waves, to impinge upon an
assemblage of such molecules, what may be expected to occur? The same as what occurs when a
piano is opened and sung into. The waves of sound select the strings which respectively respond
to them--the strings, that is to say, whose rates of vibration are the same as their own--and
of the general series of strings these only sound. The vibratory motion of the voice, imparted
first to the air, is here taken up by the strings.
