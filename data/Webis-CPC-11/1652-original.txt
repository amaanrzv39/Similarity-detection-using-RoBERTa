Any inclination, in consequence
of being generally suppressed, vents itself the more violently when an opportunity presents
itself: the greatest grossness sometimes accompanies the greatest refinement, as a natural
relief, one to the other; and we find the most reserved and indifferent tempers at the beginning
of an entertainment, or an acquaintance, turn out the most communicative and cordial at the
end of it. Some spirits exhaust themselves at first: others gain strength by progression.
