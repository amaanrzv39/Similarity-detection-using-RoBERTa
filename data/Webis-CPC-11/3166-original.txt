I saw that all of the rubber which had been continuously exposed to the intense
sunlight had changed color and had become whiter than before, and that that portion of the
balloon had lost its strength. I then returned to the use of the mercury gauge, and took the
precaution to cover my pad with cotton flannel, as a protection from the light and from other
sources of destruction. This pad is upon the roof of the Institute; and is exposed to all weathers.
As a protection from the rain and the snow, the whole is covered again with a rubber blanket.
It has withstood the exposure perfectly well for a year, without injury. The gauge, made from
flat rubber, is altogether so cheap and so convenient that I am now experimenting with one
of this description having a black cloth covering upon the outside.
