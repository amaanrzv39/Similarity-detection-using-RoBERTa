His strong individuality, a trait, whether attractive or repulsive, is brought out in even stronger relief in this volume than the last. This volume is full of interest, and worthy of study and full of suggestions. Its high energy seemed to creat demands for it to satisfy at the expense of itself. Failure only made it more persistent as well as success. It was unchillably vivacious, almost boisterous. Its strenuousness knew no lassitude, and had no need for repose. At play as well as at work, in excercise as well as mental labor, in all projects purposes, and performances, Dickens has shown a perpetual state of tension which left no room for reaction.
