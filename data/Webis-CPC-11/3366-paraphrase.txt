For now, the entire garrison appeared in the square, and ranged was facing the palace: the king, however, expected that the arrival of the artillery was to change your choice. In short, the weapons came at a gallop, but to the dismay of King Otto, who lined the battery from the palace, while the artillery, as soon as the maneuver was executed, gave a loud shout of "Long live the constitution. "

His Majesty, after a long period of silence, appeared in a ground-floor window of the palace, attended by Captain Bavaria, Hess - the most unpopular man in Greece, unless Dzine, the actor in the celebrated cases of judicial torture, could compete with him that 'bad eminence. " One of the servants of righteousness General Kalergy asked aloud, and when he came to the window the king asked him - "What is the significance of this alteration? What am I to understand your parade of the garrison?" With this Kalergy said, loudly and clearly: "The people of Greece and the desire that his Majesty's army to fulfill the promise that the country should be governed by the Constitution." Otto King then said: "Retire to your quarters, I will consult my ministers, the Council of State, and the ambassadors of the three powers of protection and inform you of my decision." This seems to the audience to perform the absolute sovereign and not too hard in the circumstances, and a slight movement of the officers, who heard the words of the king, was sent as a flash to the troops, so that the king received a different response of the army in a sudden noise of swords and the sound of gunfire.
