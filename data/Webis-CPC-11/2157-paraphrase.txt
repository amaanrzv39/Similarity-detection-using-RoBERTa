Once upon a time, the Master of Life took two pieces of clay and formed them into two feet that resembled the paws of a panther. He put his own feet into the clay forms and found them both comfortable and practical as they offered him the ability to move stealthily with great speed. Next he molded for himself a pair of very tall legs and watched them walk. Pleased with his creations, he went on to create a round torso covered with the scales of an alligator.
