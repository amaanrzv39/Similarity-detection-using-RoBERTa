As I have said, the reason of the club being around is the main focus of it collection of rare books, and of these by far the most interesting are its own publications. Its catalogues re works of art, published in numbered editions, and sought after by libraries and book-collectors. In its early history it began publishing occasional books which they thought should meet the club standard, -books in they focused on  the qualities that made a book valuable in the eyes of the collectors. The club could control its own publications, of these, age could not, of course, be imparted, but in the matter of fine and curious bindings, of hand-made linen papers, of uncut deckle edges, of wide margins and limited editions. The content was less important consideration. At first it was felt by the publishing consideration. At first it was felt by the publishing committee that nothing but the finest products of the human mind should be selected for enshroud in the beautiful volumes which the club should issue. 

An important consideration was the length of the work; -long things were not compatible with wide margins and graceful slenderness.

We brought out Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, an essay by Emerson, and another by Thoreau. Our Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam was Heron-Allen's translation of the original MS in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, which, though less poetical than FitzGerald's, was not so common. 

We began to publish the works of our own members, several years ago. Bascom's Essay on Pipes was a very creditable performance. It was sufficiently rare to be valuable for that reason.
