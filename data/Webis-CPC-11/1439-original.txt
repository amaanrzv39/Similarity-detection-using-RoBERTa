When a Stranger has walked round a Country Church-yard and glanced his eye over so many brief
chronicles, as the tomb-stones usually contain, of faithful wives, tender husbands, dutiful
children, and good men of all classes; he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of one
of the characters of a modern Tale, in a similar situation, 'Where are all the bad people buried?'
He may smile to himself an answer to this question, and may regret that it has intruded upon
him so soon.
