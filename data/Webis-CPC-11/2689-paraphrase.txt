Now I would like to convey about that man who had been carried a million dollars as a load on his back.  When I try to speak something against the Royal Family, I do not like to talk about creatures and about some important persons who created the Royal family by their own efforts.  We cannot control our laugh when we think about your own ideas in this small country and about its freedom for citizens who are walking through Canada, Australia and America and their free and independent talk.  But we are adequately having brilliance to get rid of a Monarchy and which had been taught to us by Brazil.  As I know very well that it would blister, I started to pray by taking notice Carnegie.  I started my prayer on the thin skin of a democrat.  I abandoned the title “Mr”.  You have started to talk  a lot of nonsense matters and are collaborated with most tremendous lip service. But as per your true statement, “persons are so very insignificant” is correct.
