Naval Atrocities.--In the article on "Wounds," in the Encyc. Brit., 4th edition, published
1810, the author, after mentioning the necessity of a surgeon's being cautious in pronouncing
on the character of any wound, adds that "this is particularly necessary on board ship, where,
as soon as any man is pronounced by the surgeon to be mortally wounded, he is forthwith, while
still living and conscious, thrown overboard," or words to this effect, as I quote from memory.
