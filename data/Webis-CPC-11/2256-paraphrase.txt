The majority of sea water is simply pure water, with other substances mixed in.  The most well known of these other substances is salt.  Salt is made up of molecules, which are made up of sodium and chlorine atoms.  This is the reason for sea water being 1.1 percent sodium and 2.1 percent chlorine.  In addition to salt, there are other atoms present in sea water.  Obviously, sea water contains all of the substances which the waters of the earth dissolve and carry down.  But, these substances are present in insignificant amounts.
