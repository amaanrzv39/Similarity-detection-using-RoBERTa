By the 25th nearly all of the regiment had rendezvoused on the west side
of the Big Black River, near the railroad. The next day took cars for Vicksburg.

The regiment was now, it seems, ordered to report at St. Louis, and accordingly, on the evening
of the 26th, embarked at Vicksburg on the steamboat Missouri for that place. Having arrived
at St. Louis on the 31st, it received orders to proceed to Fort Snelling, and on the 1st of
August started on the steamboat Brilliant for St. Paul. Private W. Smith was found dead in
his place on the deck on the morning of August 3rd, and his body was left at Burlington, Iowa,
for interment. On the 7th arrived at St. Paul, where a most cordial reception by the citizens
was experienced, and after being entertained at the capitol, re-embarked and went to Fort Snelling.
