In the intend time, the total garrison seemed in the quadrangle, and was stretched reverse the palace: the ruler, even so, looked frontwards to that the attainment of the artillery would change their disposition. In a short time, the armaments came galloping up; but to the utter dismay of King Otho, they were stretched in storage battery against the mansion, while the artillerymen, after the guide was implemented, granted a high size scream of "long inhabit the constitution."

His Majesty, after a long interval of intense peace, seemed at a window of the worse narrative of the mansion, joined by the Bavarian officer in accuse, Hess--the most detested man in Greece, if not Dzinos, the branch in the congratulated instances of judicial torture, could quarrel with him that "bad eminence." One of the workers of the court called for General Kalergy in a high size voice; and when he drew close to the window the ruler asked--"What is the implication of this disturbance? What am I to appreciate by this parade of the garrison?" To this Kalergy responded, in a high size and clear voice, "The population of Greece and the military forces wish for that your Majesty will redeem the agree that the nation should be administered constitutionally." King Otho then said, "Retire to your quarters; I will consider with my ministers, with the local government of state, and the ambassadors of the three looking after might, and report you of my determination." This seemed to the listeners to be simulating the unquestionable sovereign rather too toughly under the contributing elements, and a small motion of the staff, who overheard the king's remarks, was passed on like lightning to the forces, in order that the ruler accepted a distinct response from the total military forces in a swift clang of sabres and racket of arms.
