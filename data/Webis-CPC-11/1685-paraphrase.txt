It is inappropriate for a lady to use a horse that pulls hard, or hangs heavily upon the reins; yet this lady is one having the mouth so tender as to suffer from moderate pressure, because of the snaffle or the restraint.  The horse is not easily getting tired out, and the lady is distressed by the hand holding the bridle.

PERSONAL EQUIPMENTS. 
A lady has a good chance to display a refined or judicious taste, in the selection of personal equipments.  Something that is garish, unnecessary, or even elaborate is considered vulgar.
