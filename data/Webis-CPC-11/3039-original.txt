"IT."

PHASE I.

The doctor says, perfectly cheerfully and as though it were really not a matter of vital importance,
that there is no doubt that I have got IT. He remarks that IT is all over the place, and that
he has a couple of hundred other cases at the present time.

I resent his attitude as far as I have strength to do anything at all. I did not give permission
for him to be called in just to have my sufferings brushed aside like this. He only stays about
three minutes altogether, during which time he relates two funny stories (at least I suppose
they are funny, because my nurse laughs; I can't see any point in them myself), and makes several
futile remarks about the War.
