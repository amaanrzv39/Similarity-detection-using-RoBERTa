It will be noticed that the application of two coats of white zinc paint, of two coats of red lead, of coal tar & plaster of Paris mixed, of kerosene oil, of rosin & tallow mixed, of fish oil & tallow mixed & put on hot, of verdigris, of carbolic acid, of coal tar & hydraulic cement, of Davis' patent insulating compound, of compressed carbolized paper, of anti-fouling paint, of the Thilmany system, & of "vulcanized fiber," have proved failures.
The only favorable results have been that oak piles cut in the month of January & driven with the bark on have resisted one or three years, or till the bark chafed or rubbed off, & that cypress piles, well charred, have resisted for nine years.
