M. Flaubert has taken the scene of the extreme unction from a book
which a venerable ecclesiastic, one of his friends, lent to him; this same friend has read
the scene and been moved to tears, not imagining that the majesty of religion was in any way
offended. The book is entitled: An historic, dogmatic, moral, liturgical and canonical explanation
of the catechism, with an answer to the objections drawn from science against religion, by
the Abbé Ambroise Guillois, curate of Nôtre-Dame-du-Pré, 6th edition, etc., a work approved
by His Eminence the Cardinal Gousset, N.N.S.S. the Bishops and Archbishops of Mans, of Tours,
of Bordeaux, of Cologne, etc., vol. III., printed at Mans, by Charles Monnoyer, 1851.
