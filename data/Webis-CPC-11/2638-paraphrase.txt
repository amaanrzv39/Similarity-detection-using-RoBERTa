Immense applause, during which the Hon. Gentleman picks up a Cornet and plays a solo. Enthusiasm.
Mr. Farmer-Atkinson (bowing after recovering from his exertions). Ladies and Gentlemen. (Listen to, listen to!) Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen, for your cordial reception. (Applause.) And you must know, Ladies and Gentlemen, that although I have given you a solo on the cornet, I did not visit this flourishing town (cheers), this highly civilised town (renewed applause), this model town (hearty cheering), with the purpose of blowing my own trumpet. (He pauses--silence.) Don't you understand? I did not need to blow my own trumpet--joke, see? (A laugh.) Thank you! And now about the Irish Query. Well everybody harps on it. So will I. "Come back to Erin."
