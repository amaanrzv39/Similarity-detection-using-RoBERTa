I am not able to deny the fact that going to prison would be an advantage, even though I have mentally made myself ready to go to prison. So if you promise me that I will not be prosecuted, I promise to return to-morrow morning a quarter of a million dollars.  i give you five minutes for you to reply me on this proposition.  It is as plain as that and is very transparent.  As directors and individuals I want you to be faithful, and in return I will pledge, like a robber of the highest gradeâ€”a bond that would be best suited for the circumstances.

The directors as soon as they understood that to regain five-sevenths of money their originally asked for, was within their power, all at once, said in unison if Fields did not return the whole he would be punished.
