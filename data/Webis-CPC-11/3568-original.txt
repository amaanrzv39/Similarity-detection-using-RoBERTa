47. (and see note 26.), Gibbon was
too happy to make the most of the murder of the female philosopher Hypatia, by a Christian
mob at Alexandria. But the account which he gives is more shocking than the fact. He seems
not to have been familiar enough with Greek to recollect that [Greek: haneilon] means killed.
Her throat was cut with an oyster-shell, because, for a reason which he has very acutely pointed
out, oyster-shells were at hand; but she was clearly not "cut in pieces," nor, "her flesh scraped
off the bones," till after she was dead. Indeed, there was no scraping from the bones at all.
That they used oyster-shells is a proof that the act was not premeditated. Neither did she
deserve the title of modest which Gibbon gives her. Her way of rejecting suitors is disgusting
enough in Suidas.

Public Libraries.--In looking through the Parliamentary Report on Libraries, I missed, though
they may have escaped my notice, any mention of a valuable one in Newcastle-on-Tyne, "Dr. Thomlinson's;"
for which a handsome building was erected early last century, near St. Nicholas Church, and
a Catalogue of its contents has been published. I saw also, some years ago, a library attached
to Wimborne Minster, which appeared to contained some curious books.

The Garrison Library at Gibraltar is, I believe, one of the most valuable English libraries
on the continent of Europe.
