To entitle a person to claim
a human body as his own, it is not enough that he should find it in the same way in which he
finds his other sensations, namely, as impressions which interfere not with the manifestations
of each other. This is not enough, even though, in the case supposed, the person should be
the first finder. A subsequent finder would have the preference, if able to show that the particular
sensations manifested as this human body were essential to his apprehension of all his other
sensations whatsoever.
