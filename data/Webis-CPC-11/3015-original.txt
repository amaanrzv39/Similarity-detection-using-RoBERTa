We do not hesitate to say that the royal dignity,
even with the support of England and France, is not worth ten years' purchase until this is

Every traveller who visits Greece declaims against the number of coffee-houses throughout the
country, and the hosts of idle people with which they are filled. But nothing else can be expected
in a country where the system of agriculture keeps the cultivators idle for three months annually,
and deprives the proprietor of all profit from his land. Under such circumstances the demand
for labour becomes extremely irregular. Many of the lower classes turn brigands and plunder
their neighbours; the educated and higher classes turn government employ√©s and plunder the
country.
