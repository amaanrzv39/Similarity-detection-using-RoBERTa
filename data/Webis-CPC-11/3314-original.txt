[Footnote: Official Records, vol.
xxxviii. pt. v. pp. 85, 89, 93.] This, of course, decided Johnston to abandon the northern
bank of the river, and he selected a strong position behind Peach-tree Creek as the next line
of defence for Atlanta, burning the railway bridge and other bridges behind him.

Several days were occupied by Sherman in moving McPherson's command to Roswell, twenty miles
above the railway, and building a trestle-bridge there, in accumulating supplies and organizing
transportation for another considerable absence from the railroad. By the 17th the army was
over the Chattahoochee, McPherson on the left, Schoneld next, and Thomas from the centre to
the right. A general wheel of the whole toward the right was ordered, to find and drive back
the enemy upon Atlanta.

Meanwhile the relations between General Johnston and the Confederate government had reached
a crisis. He had regularly reported the actual movements of his army, but had carefully avoided
any indication of his intentions or of his hopes or fears. When, on the 5th of July, he retreated
to the position at the Chattahoochee crossing, his dispatch briefly announced that "In consequence
of the enemy's advance toward the river below our left, we this morning took this position,
which is slightly intrenched." [Footnote: Official Records, vol. xxxviii. pt. v. p. 865.] Mr.
Davis replied on the 7th, expressing grave apprehensions at the situation, pointing out the
dangers of the position, and saying that other places had been stripped to reinforce him, that
further increase was impossible, and that they now depended on his success.
