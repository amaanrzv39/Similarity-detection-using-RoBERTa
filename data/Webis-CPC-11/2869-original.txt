April 26.--Was made an Oddfellow to-day. Initiation didn't last long. CHORKLE and JERRAM were
initiated with me, and we all had to make speeches afterwards, declaring our devotion to the
great cause of Oddfellowship. Afterwards sentiments were called for. The only one I remember
was given by a man called TABSEY, a tailor, who seems to be rather famous for this kind of
thing. After holding his hand to his head for some time, and knitting his brows, he cleared
his throat, and said, in a loud voice,--"May the tear of true sympathy crystallise as it falls,
and be worn as a radiant jewel upon the finger of affliction." This was vociferously applauded.
I congratulated TABSEY afterwards, and paid him a compliment about it.
