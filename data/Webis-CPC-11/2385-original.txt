This with our best friends, who, no doubt, feel the same about us. But on the other
line of approach, the study of the things on which men now agree without question, which they
have built up steadily with co-operating hands, the mental effect is quite different. The opening
vista leads us on, with growing admiration and confidence in the unbreakable solidarity of
mankind. We know that Newton who completes Galileo, Maxwell who follows Laplace, Helmholtz
who uses the results of Joule, can have no conflicting jealousies.
