At one table, sat a lieutenant of Uhlans with his girlfriend of the moment, and at another table sat a happy older flirting man waving at a blushing chorus girl from the Theater des Westerns, and she in return sends him a looser flirting nod. At another table (one table away from the table with two prostitutes quickly eating with their hands a large leg of English roast beef with German garnishes) sat a family man with his family. At still another table sat another family man with his family.
