I have not met elsewhere with any allusion to this
passage, or the atrocity recorded in it, and would be glad of more information on the subject.

Turlehydes.--During the great famine in Ireland land in 1331, it is said that--

    "The people in their distress met with an unexpected and providential
    relief. For about the 24th June, a prodigious number of large sea fish,
    called turlehydes, were brought into the bay of Dublin, and cast on
    shore at the mouth of the river Dodder.
