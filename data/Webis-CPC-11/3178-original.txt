In a lucid interval, while I was doing a call of
my own, the operator, without giving me any warning, switched me on to the supervisor. This
must have been an inspiration from Olympus. However I was equal to the emergency; nay, took
advantage of it. Experience has taught me that it is always best to talk to the person you
get, whether you want that person or not. So I explained to the supervisor that I was a busy
man, although the rumour which ascribed to my shoulders the War Office, the Timber Control
and the L.D.C.S. was, at the moment, unfounded.

She played up magnificently; took my number, my name, my address, the date, the time of the
day, how many times I had been rung up, whom by and when, and was going to ask me the date
of my birth and whether I was married or single, when I protested.
