We know the general direction of Bremen from the camp  and it was the largest town near it. It was easy to locate it from the reflection of its lights against the sky.
          On August 25th it was raining heavily and it was cold also. We were hiding on the bank of weser. As the river was two hundere yards broad we need a boat to cross the river. we were happy to meet a cow.  We made a pair of socks out of a shirt. We had turnips, carrots and milk as our food. 
        On august 26th we found a boat to cross the river. As there were a lot of hedges grown so heavily we  have to go around them. It ook a lot time . Meal for the day wer turnip,peas and oats
