Most of her people lay fathoms deep in a tomb made in the
twinkling of an eye by the collapse of their homes, and sealed forever under tons of boiling
mud, avalanches of scoria and a hurricane of volcanic dust.

Over the entombed city the volcano from a dozen vents yet poured its steaming vapors in long,
curling wreaths, that mounted thousands of feet aloft, like smoking incense from a gigantic
censer above the bier of some mighty dead.

Such was the disaster which burst upon the hapless people of the island of Martinique, while
almost at the same moment a sister isle, St. Vincent, was suffering a kindred fate. Similar
in natural conditions, these two little colonies of the West Indies, one French and one English
by affiliation, underwent the shock of nature's assault and sank in grief before a horror-stricken
world.

There are some inconsistencies in the chapter subheadings between the Table of Contents and
chapters themselves; these have been left as printed.

There is some variation in factual information--for example, the amount held in the Mint. These
occurrences have all been preserved as printed.

There is some variable spelling; this has been repaired where there was an obvious prevalence
of one form over the other, but is otherwise left as printed. There is a reference on page
112 to "gambling hells", which seems to be a genuine term, although it could be a typo for
"gambling halls". Since there is no way to be certain, it has been preserved as printed.
