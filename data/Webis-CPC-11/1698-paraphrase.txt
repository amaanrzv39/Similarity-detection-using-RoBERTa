To sum it up, she said:

"My husband's a traditional farmer who doesn't use modern things.  So naturally, I don't get any help with my 'women's work' even though we all know women are the real heads of the household.  But still, I would follow him if he ever chose to move on.  I wonder if other's out there feel the same way?"
