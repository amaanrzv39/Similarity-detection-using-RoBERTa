The burglars then proceeded to
the hall, and knocked at the back door.  One of the servant girls asked who was there.  She
received the reply, “Open the door, Betty.”  She did so, whereupon four or five men rushed
into the kitchen. One of the maids escaped, and ran to the room where Mr. and Mrs. Elsey were
sitting.  Mr. Elsey was smoking his pipe, and Mrs. Elsey was preparing something for supper.
She saved her silver spoon, which she was using, by slipping it into her bosom.
