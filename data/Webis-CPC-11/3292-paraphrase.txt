He will give us his views on the Land Question (all sixty-two of them, even!) in watercolor paintings, which are all bright, breezy, and delightful. If they have Home Rile, or if they insist on having Ireland for the Irish, then we will have no wish to start a fight over this polished painting. And if we are not allowed to have the real thing, we will find the outright ownership of Mr. RICKATSON'S wonderful pictures to be a sub-par substitute.

THE THIEF

TO ALL VOLAPuK-SPEAKING FOLK:

There exists, at this very moment, no body or organization which could even hope to be to the Volapuk-speaking world what We were whilst We remained in Northumberland Street, where We typically looked over things. The wise are few, and governing minds are even fewer. But We have that mind, one which We have determined to put to use with a new monthly publication. From the start We- being human, after all- were confronted by the difficulty of finding an adequate title. Several people suggested themselves, thinking of a Mind not lacking in meaning. A few may be mentioned. There was the Filibuster, the Summum Bone-'em, Macheath's Miscellany, the Monthly Marauder, the Eviscerator, the Literary Leech, the Monthly Misappropriator, the Sixpenny Scoop. Each has its own unique alliteration and appeal.
