The second requirement--that of securing "a disciplined mind." Here again it is essential to
commence to instil the principles which form a disciplined mind as early as possible in the
boy's early youth. Self-denial, obedience to the orders of their superiors, and respect and
affection for their elders, are perhaps the most important of these principles.

This task may again be safely left to the officers of the Education Department.

It will be seen, therefore, that the first two requirements may be obtained by a system, as
advocated above, to be imparted to all boys in their early youth by those who are charged with
their elementary education, and it is urged that such system should be uniform and form part
of the school curriculum, the teachers being required to qualify to impart the necessary instruction.
