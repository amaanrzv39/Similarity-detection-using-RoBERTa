I have always considered it a fantasy, the breasts of a Moorish woman, from what I've been told.  But now I am convinced of my error. I have seen one of these Moorish women, teased by one of her own kids.  They threw one of her breasts with such force that it almost reached the ground.

Her son could barely walk, but his mother still prepares his food and serves it to him before she herself has been served.
