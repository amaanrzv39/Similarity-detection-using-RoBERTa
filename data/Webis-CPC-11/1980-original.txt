You know MY opinion! It is the same as it ever was--I
never change! When I have once made up my mind, it is a fixture! I have said already and I
say it again, that the church was quite good enough for such people as live here, in its original
condition, and that you have really spent a great deal of cash on a very needless work! I mustn't
be rude, no, no, no!--but you know the old adage: 'Fools and their money!' Ha-ha-ha! But we
shan't quarrel. Oh, dear no! It has cost ME nothing, I am glad to say!
