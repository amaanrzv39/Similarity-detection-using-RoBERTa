Eyelashes can be made to grow longer, by trimming them in infancy.  But after growing into a big girl of the age of wearing long skirts and doing different hair styles and wearing a small hat with decorations of different sorts on it, eye lashes cannot be made to grow longer by cutting. Applying castor oil on the lashes will help in increasing the growth. Moistened salt has also proved a good growth enhancer.
THE EYEBROWS. 
Eyebrows can be made into elegant curves by an action of careful pinching and they should be brushed well.  Heavy eyebrows can be easily shaped. The brushing should be short but stiff and firm. This will help in cleansing and revitalizing.  
Penciled eyebrows are not a beauty.  Marvelous change may be effected by a profession in the ‘make-up’ art by touching the eyebrows here and there. 
I cannot approve of penciled eyebrows. A professional in the "make-up" art can touch the eyebrows here and there and bring a marvelous change.
