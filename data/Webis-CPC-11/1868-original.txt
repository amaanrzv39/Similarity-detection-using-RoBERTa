This melts the gum in the powder and fastens
the pattern to the material. The iron should be as hot as possible without scorching the cloth.
Should the heat change the color of the material, iron it all over. Do not do any stamping
by this process on a hot or damp day if it can be avoided. Keep the powder in a cool, dry place.
In stamping with light-colored powder, the best way to fasten it is to hold the back of the
cloth against the stovepipe or the face of the iron.
