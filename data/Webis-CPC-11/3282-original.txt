When you let your Wort from your Malt into the Underback, put to it a Handful or two of Hops,
'twill preserve it from that accident which Brewers call Blinking or Foxing.

In boiling your Worts, the first Wort boil high or quick; for the quicker the first Wort is
boiled, the better it is.

The second boil more than the first, and the third or last more than the second.

In cooling lay your Worts thin, and let each be well cooled, and Care must be taken in letting
them down into the Tun, that you do it leisurely, to the end that as little of the Feces or
Sediment which causes the Fermentation to be fierce or mild, for Note, there is in all fermented
Liquors, Salt and Sulphur, and to keep these two Bodies in a due Proportion, that the Salt
does not exalt itself above the Sulphur, consists a great part of the Art in Brewing.

When your Wort is first let into your Tun, put but a little Yeast to it, and let it work by
degrees quietly, and if you find it works but moderate, whip in the Yeast two or three times
or more, till you find your Drink well fermented, for without a full opening of the Body by
fermentation, it will not be perfect fine, nor will it drink clean and light.

When you cleanse, do it by a Cock from your Tun, placed six Inches from the Bottom, to the
end that most of the Sediment may be left behind, which may be thrown on your Malt to mend
your Small Beer.
