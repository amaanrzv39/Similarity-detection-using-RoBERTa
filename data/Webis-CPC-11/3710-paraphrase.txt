With that, and with a cry, he rushed onto the Wanderer, his great axe dangled aloft, towards collapsed him at a blow.

But whilst the giant had been singing, the Wanderer had shifted his site a little, so that the red blaze of the background sun was within his face. And as the mighty man arrived onto, the Wanderer raised up his golden shelter and caught the sunlight onto it, and flashed it full within the giant's eyes, so that he was dazzled, and could not see towards strike. Then the Wanderer smote at his naked right arm, and punched it onto the joint of the elbow; with everybody his drag he smote, and the short sword of Euryalus bit deep, and the arm collapsed, with the axe within the hand-grip. But so horrible was the stroke that bronze powers not abide it, and the blade was shattered from the ivory handle.

"Didst thou feel aught, thou Man-eater?" cried Odysseus, jeering, for he knew from the tune of the giant that he was face towards face with a wanderer from an evil race, that of old had smitten his ships and eaten his men--the Laestrygons of the land of the Midnight Sun, the Man-eaters.

But the giant caught up his club of pine-tree within his deserted hand, the severed right arm still clinging towards it. And he gnawed onto the handle of the masonry axe with his teeth, and bit the very masonry, and his lips foamed, for a fury arrived upon him. Roaring aloud, suddenly he smote at the Wanderer's brain, and hammered down his shelter, and crushed his golden helm so that he collapsed onto one knee, and everybody was darkness round him. But his hands lit onto a great masonry, for the site whereas they battled was the holy site of an ancient temple, old and impaired ahead of King Mena's day. He grasped the masonry with both hands; it was the basalt brain of a declined statue of a God or a man, of a king long nameless, or of a forgotten God.
