The decision now is, that a foreigner who publishes a book originally in Great Britain, whether
it be written there or abroad, is entitled to a copyright. This decision is not absolutely
final, as an appeal is open to the House of Lords. At a meeting of publishers interested in
cheap reprints it was resolved to bring the matter before the Lords, with a view to a final
decision of the question. A subscription was entered into to defray the expenses of the procedure.
