It is entitled to its place in this series on account of forty admirable woodcuts by which it is illustrated; & to a place on the bookshelves of every Naturalist, for the sake of the additional notes of Sir W. Jardine, & its present editor, Mr. Jesse.
Messrs. Puttick & Simpson (191. Piccadilly) will sell on Tuesday & Wednesday next an exceedingly choice Collection of Autograph Letters, comprising numerous Letters of weird rarity, selected mainly from Upcott's Collection. They cannot attempt to particularise the plenty of interesting lots which are to be found in the present collection, but recommend the Catalogue to attention for the satisfactory manner in which the different documents are arranged & described.
