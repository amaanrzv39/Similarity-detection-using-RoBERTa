Or do you think he slept? (No response.) I think his dad probably asleep half the time he should be working?

Barbara. Probly. What's in your bag?

Julia. I expect he chair stands in the sea is just a weeny bit too comfortable for real work.

Barbara. I eated up all choc'lates you did get me.

Julia. Maybe I'll find something more now. Do you think Father writes in his sleep?

Barbara. Yes, I Fink he.

Julia. Listen, Suzie. I expect he just dreams really works. Not you, Babs?

At this point I thought it desirable for the sake of preserving remnants of my parental authority, to come to tea. Julia Barbara was teaching a package of chocolate, and welcomed me with a spring survey to determine if I was busy writing. I answered yes, with an appetite.

"You should hear what your daughter has been said about you," said Julia.

"Oh, and do not tell Barbara?" I asked.

"She says that when father is in the stuffy little room that it usually write in my sleep It really takes notice of the most amazing things. And how it expresses itself is quite strange. "

"So says Barbara write in my sleep?"

"Yes, you heard it right, Suzie? Oh, and I tell you that the other day during the heavy storm, she said that angels and demons must be having a great battle and that it angels should soon be going over the top? "

"Come here, Barbara," I said.
