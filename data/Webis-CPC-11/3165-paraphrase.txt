Flacius Illyricus, named after Illyria where he was born in Istria, and sometimes known as Matthias Flach-Franconitz was a prolific writer on some of the most controversial issues in the fifteen hundreds. His main focus once he became a disciple of Luther was on raising continuous disputes about religious matters, and it was noted that his arguments were vigorous, aggressive and exaggerated. According to one German historian "he seemed to have been created for an ecclesiastical Procurator General". After he died in 1575 his friend Jacques Andreas admitted that really his Illyricus was the devil's Ullyricus, and that in his opinion he was now "supping with devils"*
