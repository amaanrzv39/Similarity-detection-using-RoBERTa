Mr. Ash has twice before competed, and each time came out a close second; but his old luck
did not entirely forsake him, for in his venture for the Roman Scholarship Prize he was very
near to the front, winning honorable mention.

H.L. Duhring, Jr., was a close second for the U. of P. Scholarship.

At the last regular T Square Club meeting, but two sets of drawings were submitted. The program
called for a "Garden for a Palatial Country House," and required a plan of the house and terrace
at 1/8" scale, and a plan and section of the entire garden at a scale of 1/32 of an inch.

The problem was modeled after the projet given at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, and required so
vast an amount of graded wash work in color, as to intimidate many of the regular competitors.
A.C. Mu√±oz, who won first mention, submitted three drawings, two of them nearly three by four
feet, while Albert Kelsey was disqualified for not having fulfilled the requirements by omiting
the 1/8" scale plan.

Some discussion advocating the postponement of the competition took place, but Kelsey seemed
to prefer being disqualified rather than further exert himself; and possibly the knowledge
that three draughtsmen in Day's office and two in Cope & Stewardson's office had two unfinished
designs to complete, may have influenced him. In spite of the result of this competition the
eleven points previously won by Mr. Kelsey give him the highest average for the past year's work.
