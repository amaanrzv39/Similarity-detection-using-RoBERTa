Theorizing from the comprehensive study of the ability of the dancer to put experience to work, I assume that if the sound of the bell was heard by it, soon it would understand that it should avoid the box from where the sound came and enter the other one which did not ring the bell.

No. 4 was subjected to systematic complete tests from the 3rd to the 12th of February, 1906. For ten times in a series, the mouse was allowed to locate his path passing through one of the small boxes to the nest-box, every day.  The bell for the boxes on the left and right were rang alternatively by the experimenter.  Depending on the speed with which the mouse moved to his box, the time taken for this sequence of experiments differed.
