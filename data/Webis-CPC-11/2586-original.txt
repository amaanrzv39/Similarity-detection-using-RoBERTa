And because it sees the difficulty of being in filth and not defiled, it longs with
breathless desire and burning charity to free itself by one act from the world so far as possible.
If it is not able to escape in deed, it studies to be perfect in its own place. At least, it
does not lack desire.

Then, dearest brother, let us sleep no more, but awaken from slumber. Open the eye of the mind
in the light of faith, to know, to love, to follow that truth which you shall know through
the Blood of the humble and loving Lamb. You shall know that Blood in the knowledge of yourself,
that the face of your soul may be washed therein. And it is ours, and none can take it from
us unless we choose.
