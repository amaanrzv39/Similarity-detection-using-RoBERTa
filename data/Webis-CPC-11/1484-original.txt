It is evident, therefore,
that the wire may be continued to such a length that the current will no longer have sufficient
intensity to produce at the station to which the despatch is transmitted those effects by which
the language of the despatch is signified. But the intensity of the current transmitted by
a given voltaic battery upon a wire of given length will be increased in the same proportion
as the area of the section of the wire is augmented.
