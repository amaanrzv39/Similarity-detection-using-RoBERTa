If those foolish Brits light the torch of war against Germany, they will lose big time. As Germans, the gains are ours. March, march! Commence the fight. 

Our people, the good and righteous Germans, are known by the glorious deeds of our chiefs and some great German bands. Many a heroic German has died on the battlefield. Those hostile Brits will cower as we approach, kissing our feet and bowing. There, we will victoriously twine a laurel wreath on every tree trunk we can find.

Hasta Manana, my little grass shack. Goodbye forever, my little backyard garden.
