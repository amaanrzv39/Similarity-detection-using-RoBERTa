Actually,I dont know additional scriptwriter who could have re-told attractive English romance with such gentleness and such command ,neither losing the attraction of the old tale nor forgetting the circumstances of the new form. The sentiment of the poet and the science of the dramatist are elegantly balanced in it. For though in  text it is a poem, and while a poem it is also a play. 

But propitious as Mr. Wills has been in the selection of his subject and in his treatment of it, he is also lucky in the actors who infer his job.
