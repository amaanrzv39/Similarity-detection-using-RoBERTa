The view from the window after Saturday's breakfast is altogether changed.  The tradesmen's
families have all come back again.  The serious stationer's young woman of all work is shaking
a duster out of the window of the combination breakfast-room; a child is playing with a doll,
where Mr. Thurtell's hair was brushed; a sanitary scrubbing is in progress on the spot where
Mr. Palmer's braces were put on.  No signs of the Races are in the streets, but the tramps
and the tumble-down-carts and trucks laden with drinking-forms and tables and remnants of booths,
that are making their way out of the town as fast as they can.
