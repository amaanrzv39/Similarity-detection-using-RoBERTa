The city was likely once magnificent, but now it was in ruins.  The main temple was of the Sun.  The entire city was full of ruined colonnades and columns.  One of the colonnades was even a mile long.

I saw a little of the Palmytra's inner life, partially because I dressed like a man.  Dressed that way, I could go almost anywhere i wanted and go into all the places that women were not typically allowed.  The hardest part for me was going to the bathroom, which always had to be done in the middle of the night.
