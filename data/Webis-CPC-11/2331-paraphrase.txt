A few miles upriver from Jamestown, at Falling Creek, the English built their first iron furnace in The united states in 1620-21. Iron was smelted in the furnace, as well as a few tools were forged--the first iron objects made in the New World by the English. In 1622 the Indians massacred the ironworkers and their families, and destroyed the furnace. Although it was seldom rebuilt, its importance cannot be overstressed, for the Falling Creek site can rightfully claim the honor of being the birthplace of the American iron industry.
