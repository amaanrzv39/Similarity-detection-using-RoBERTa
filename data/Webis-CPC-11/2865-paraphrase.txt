Desmodium gyrans has two lateral leaflets that are smaller than leaves of plants in the same genus.  These leaves only appear on the plant when it is in the growing stages, and once the plant is full grown these leaflets fall off.  However, these leaflets aren't on seedlings, and only appear on the plants once 10 to 20 normal leaves have been formed.  Sometimes only one of the leaflets is grown, and sometime they are both absent.
