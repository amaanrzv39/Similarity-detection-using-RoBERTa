The executants are twenty in number but one plays the drums, Mr. Rammond, who leads them; another the bone castanet; but the third, he cannot play any instrumen; but the five others, all guitar players.  The castanet player sings well; but some of his friends have good voices, and, in glees, they harmonize very well.  In a triad, the melody on the Phantom Chrous, from Bellini's 'Sonnambula'; and in a glee, 'You'll See Them on the Ohio,' nothing can be more effective than the skillful blending of the parts.
