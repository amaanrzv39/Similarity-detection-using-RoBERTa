The brain becomes the chief working muscle of the system. We refine and re-refine the intellectual
powers down to a diamond point and brilliancy, as if they were the sole or reigning faculties,
and we had not a physical nature binding us to earth, and a spiritual nature binding us to
the great heavens and the greater God who inhabits them. Thus the university becomes a sort
of splendid hospital with this difference, that the hospital cures, while the university creates
disease.
