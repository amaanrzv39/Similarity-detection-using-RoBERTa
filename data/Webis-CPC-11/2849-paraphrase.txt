These angry chiefs have come to a conclusion, in which they have decided to terminate their alliance,when the queen mother enters and tries to strike a mutual agreement with them.But,the queen,Isabeau, with her coarse temper, unnatural hatred towards her own son Charles is a very disagreeable person altogether.Isabeau can offer a woman against woman, so extremely cunning. She has decided to lead her own party against Johanna.They are all awaiting her return to Paris.They say that the army is dispirited when it thinks of such an awful cause, a  mother against her son.

Isabeau says that the people who disagree with the cause are weak souls of a wronged mother.She is person who honours the people who love her and injures the ones who hate her,even if it is her son.Since her son is against her,she hates him more.
