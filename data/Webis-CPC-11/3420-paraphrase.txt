Our thoughts half arise for a time from the dim continuum of essential feeling and diffused sense, and are scarcely fastened before they are modified and altered, by the transferring of alertness and the awareness of new family, into thoughts of truly divergent objects. This fluidity of the psyche would make reflection impractical, did we not mend in remarks and other icons certain abstract contents; we hence become competent of acknowledging in one awareness the repetition of another, and of acknowledging in certain recurrences of appearances a unrelenting object. This discrimination and classification of the contents of consciousness is the work of awareness and appreciating, and the enjoyments that supplement these pursuits make the prettiness of the wise world.

But our retain upon our thoughts broadens even further. We not only build noticeable unities and recognizable sorts, but continue mindful of their affinities to what is not at the time perceived; that is, we find in them a certain leaning to and worth, not primary to them, a implication and a sound, which upon examination we will observe to have been the appropriate characteristics of other item and emotions, linked with them one time in our experience. The hushed reverberations of these linked emotions carry on in the head, and by modifying our present response, shade of colour the photograph upon which our alertness is fixed. The worth hence procured by item through association is what we call their expression.
