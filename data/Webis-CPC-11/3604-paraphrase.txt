We hear a lot about the famous personalities, Shakespeare and Homer, but their fame is going to end soon. Death is certain and it happens to everyone, even to God. Death comes for bringing a change to the pre-existing. Small changes result in a grand change.

   Life is very unpredictable. Nobody knows that how long he is goin to survive. Some creatures enter next lifeform after death, while some have a very small life. These living beings live for very short period, but they serve as food to other beings so that they can live long. Shakespeare and Handels are such kind of beings.

  The unpredictable nature of life can be reflected in a person's reputation too. Sometimes the strong personalities live shorter than those who are unexpected. Its very uncertain that on what basis this age limit is classified. More often, its believed that people who do gud live long, but nobody is sure about such beliefs whether these hold true in their case or not.

  In this world, where life is so uncertain, young writers have found a solution to live long. Although they might not live too long, still they get to live even after they die through their writings.
