He was
not fitted by temperament to assimilate anything quite so strenuously chromatic as that, and
as a consequence shortly after he had retired to his studio for the night the conflicting tints
began to get in their deadly work and within two hours he was completely doubled up. The pain
he suffered was awful. Agony was bliss alongside of the pangs that now afflicted him and all
the palliatives and pain killers known to man were tried without avail, and then, just as he
was about to give himself up for lost, an amateur cornetist who occupied a studio on the floor
above began to play the Lost Chord. A counter-pain set in immediately. At the second bar of
the Lost Chord the awful pain that was gradually gnawing away at his vitals seemed to lose
its poignancy in the face of the greater suffering, and physical relief was instant. As the
musician proceeded the internal disorder yielded gradually to the external and finally passed
away entirely, leaving him so far from prostrated that by one A.M. he was out of bed and actually
girding himself with a shotgun and an Indian Club to go upstairs for a physical encounter with
the cornetist."

"And you reason from this that Sullivan's Lost Chord is a cure for Cholera morbus, eh?" sneered
the Doctor.

"It would seem so," said the Idiot. "While the music continued my friend was a well man ready
to go out and fight like a warrior, but when the cornetist stopped--the colic returned and
he had to fight it out in the old way. In these episodes in my own experience I find ample
justification for my belief and that of others that some day the music cure for human ailments
will be recognized and developed to the full.
