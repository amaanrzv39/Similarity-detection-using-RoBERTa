I remember asking
him why he called her Lucie, and he was surprised to hear her name was Marie; he never knew
her, he had never been to Alphonsine's, and he had told the story as he had picked it up from
the women who turned into the Rat Mort at midnight for a soupe a l'oignon. He said it was a
pity he did not know me when he was writing it, for I could have told him her story more sympathetically
than the women in the Rat Mort, supplying him with many pretty details that they had never
noticed or had forgotten.
