At 3 o'clock Monday afternoon Dr. Robert Carothers, of Newport, made a post-mortem examination
of the body at White's undertaking establishment. It was made in the presence of Dr. J. O.
Jenkins, Drs. J. L. and C. T. Phythian, Dr. J. W. Fishback and Coroner W. S. Tingley. The examination
occupied over an hour, and was very thorough. The result was the finding of a foetus of between
four or five months' gestation. The doctors also came to the conclusion that the woman was
not over 20 years of age, and that she had never before been pregnant. The foetus was removed
and taken to A. F. Goetze's pharmacy, corner of Fifth and York Streets, where it was placed
in alcohol for preservation.
