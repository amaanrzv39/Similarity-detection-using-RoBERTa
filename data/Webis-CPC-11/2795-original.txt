The love of Michael for Luke is inwrought with his love for his home and for the land
which surrounds it.  These he desires at his death to hand down unencumbered to his son.  "I
have attempted," Wordsworth wrote to Poole, "to give a picture of a man of strong mind and
lively sensibility, agitated by two of the most powerful affections of the human heart--the
parental affection and the love of property, landed property, including the feelings of inheritance,
home and personal and family independence."
