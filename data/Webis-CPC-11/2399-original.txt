What have the descendants
of the great Zenobia done to come to this?  We dined at the Shaykh's house, and had our coffee
and pipes.  Later we returned to our camp, which consisted of our five tents and ten for the
eighty soldiers.  It was picturesquely placed, close to the east of the grand colonnade of
Palmyra, for the sake of being near the wells, and the animals were picketed as much as possible
in the shelter, for during our sojourn there we suffered from ice and snow, sirocco, burning
heat, and furious sou'westers.
