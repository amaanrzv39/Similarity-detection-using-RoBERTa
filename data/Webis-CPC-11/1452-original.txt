The Portuguese historians say that De Sousa and Asada Khan both joined the ranks of the supporters
of Abdullah, and that Asada Khan promised to give the king of Portugal all the territories
of the Konkan on the downfall of Ibrahim, but the Viceroy changed his mind and withdrew, while
Asada Khans death put a stop to all intrigues in that quarter.

Firishtah's account, however, of the conduct of Asada at this period totally differs, as do
his dates.
