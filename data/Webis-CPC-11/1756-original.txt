The Princess Helena became Princess Christian of
Schleswig-Holstein. The Princess Louise has gone somewhat out of the usual course of British
princesses and in 1871 married the Marquis of Lorne, Duke of Argyll since 1900. A daughter
born October 24, 1887, was baptised at Balmoral, the first royal christening which had taken
place in Scotland for three hundred years.

Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, married the favourite child and only daughter of the late Emperor
of Russia, and sister of the Czar.
