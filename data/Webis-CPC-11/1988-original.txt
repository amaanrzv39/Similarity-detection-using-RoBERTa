There has not been a Law-suit in the Parish
  since he has liv'd among them: If any Dispute arises they apply
  themselves to him for the Decision; if they do not acquiesce in his
  Judgment, which I think never happened above once or twice at most,
  they appeal to me. At his first settling with me, I made him a Present
  of all the good Sermons [which [3]] have been printed in
  English, and only begg'd of him that every Sunday he
  would pronounce one of them in the Pulpit.
