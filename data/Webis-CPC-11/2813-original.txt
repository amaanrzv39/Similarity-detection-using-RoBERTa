In September 1819, John Gird had a note endorsed for $4,100
by Isaac Entwistle, and mortgaged some of his personal possessions which were listed as "one
clock, one sideboard, two mahogany dining tables, two tea ditto, one pair card tables, one
secretary, two bureaus, one writing desk, one dozen rush bottom chairs, one ditto with settee
to match, one sofa, two looking glasses, carpets, brass andirons, two fenders, shovel, tongs,
window curtains, three bedsteads and beds, chair, wash stand, chest, house linen, one set gilt
tea china, four waiters, one half dozen silver teaspoons, one set plated castors, sundry glass
and earthen ware, kitchen furniture, etc."[121]

Six years later this debt was not cleared up and John Gird secured the debt with his house
and lot.
