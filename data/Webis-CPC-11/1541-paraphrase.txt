The most effecient use of the gamp is to use it for poking, stabbing and for defense. Using the gamp for hitting is an impractical use, as the instrument is prone to fall apart when thrust with force. The handles aren't nearly strong enough for any sort of impact. The silk folds of the gamp also protect the person being hit, showing that hitting is an improper use of the gamp for protection.
