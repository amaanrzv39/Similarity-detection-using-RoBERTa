Mankind has long struggled with nature in this permanently winter region.  There are few civilized areas, few villages and the land is not inhabited by many.  The land is void of population leaving nothing to converse about and leaving nothing to do including these areas of northern Sweden and Russia and for 8 months of year a perpetual night and winter descends on the land.  

After the treaty of Tilsit, Emporer Alexander took control of Finland; Alexander was able to do this because the Swedish throne was occuppied by a deranged monarch, Gustavus IV.  This madness rendered Gustavus incapable of defending his land.  Despite a high moral character, the prince knew even from his youth that he was incapable of reigning properly.  The Swedes fought for Finland with tremendous bravery; but without a warrior for king, the less numerous country could not defeat the more powerful enemy.  
Emperor Alexander took over Finland by conquering the land combined with treaties based on force; but in his defense he ruled Finland liberally allowing the Finns many liberties they previously enjoyed.  He permitted the Finns to raise their own taxes and men; he provided the Finns with generous assistance that had been burnt, and his favors compensated for what the Finns possessed as rights, if free men can ever be said to accept voluntarily to that sort of demand.
