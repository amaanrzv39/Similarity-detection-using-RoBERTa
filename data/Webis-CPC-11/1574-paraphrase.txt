The  end result of this conference was, that, as Frederick's footwear were fast approaching the character of sandals with leather thongs, they were surreptitiously taken away from his bedside at night, and their place filled by a pair of  boots, which would carry him well into the  chilly winter. That was yesterday, and meanwhile, today, no coals; no kindlings, if there had been; and last year's bill due,  winter fast approaching; the night growing cold and blustery.
