We should get an ideal of Christ as that of St. Francis, or St. Theresa and that of the English prayer book, even if we took the real meaning of the Gospels and accepted what is said about Christ.  It would be the Christ who men loved and adored, the built up of a living and intimately understood personality, from the parts of story and doctrine which connects the name.  All the prayers, all the acceptances, all the penances, charities, and sacrifices and half the art of the Christian world are inspired by this subjective image.

The insufficient legend of Virgin Mary, who has enormously inspired the imagination of the Catholics, gives a plain illustration of the building up of an ideal form of Christ.  The incarnation and the crucifixion are the two spontaneous sympathetic events which formed the basis of things. These mighty scenes, illuminate the figure of the Virgin and makes us think of her freedom from original sin, and her universal motherhood.  Thus we form in ourselves the noblest and beautiful of characters.  The Protestant mind does not give an inspection of this ideal due to its foolish iconoclasm and that is a pity.
