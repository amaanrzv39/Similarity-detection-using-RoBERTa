Where is the proof? The Learned Public Prosecutor thought that it would serve him well to indicate that more proof could be presented at a later stage in the court hearing. This, I am sure will weigh on the mind of the commissioner as it would have if we had suggested that there is a large amount of proof that is to be presented to the court on behalf of Mr. Davis. This is not a game of boasting. It is not evidence that is not present but the evidence that is presented that the case wil be decided. Pride has been broken, Fear of Executive power, surprising everyone, terrorising everyone and disabling the judgments of men.
