ANAGRAMS.

   " I saw TENT SUDS by the BATTLE-SCREENS, puzzling over THE MICA MATS, and perplexed about MANY ROOTS."
     The words printed in capitals are anagrams of the words that should occupy the same places, so as to make sense.
     BATTLE-SCREENS is a compound-word that takes place of the right word, "centre-table".But all other words in  capital are anagrams with single word.
