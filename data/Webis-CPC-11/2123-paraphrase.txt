In regards to rheumatism, there are no more than one in fifty joints that are left permanently damaged by rheumatism. One bout of rheumatic fever will leave the person as well as the person's joint more susceptible to other attacks. "Once rheumatic, always rheumatic" was the slogan of the British during the war of 1812.
