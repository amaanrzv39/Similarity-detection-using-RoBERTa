It is surprising to notice that many literary men have had such a taste in respecto to their wifes. Many of them have been dissolute, ill-humoured, slatternly, and have run into all the frivolities of the age. However, the wife of Budaeus was different.

It is delightful when the mind of the female is happily disposed, it is richly cultivated as much as to be involved in the liverary avocation of her husband! The intercourse of the sexes is a great pleasure. Budaeus for example, must have been very happy, even in those works which must have been for others a most dreadful labour!
