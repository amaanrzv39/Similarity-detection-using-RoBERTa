Even if we took the literal narrative of the Gospels
and accepted it as all we could know of Christ, without allowing ourselves any imaginative
interpretation of the central figure, we should get an ideal of him, I will not say very different
from that of St. Francis or St. Theresa, but even from that of the English, prayer-book. The
Christ men have loved and adored is an ideal of their own hearts, the construction of an ever-present
personality, living and intimately understood, out of the fragments of story and doctrine connected
with a name. This subjective image has inspired all the prayers, all the conversions, all the
penances, charities, and sacrifices, as well as half the art of the Christian world.

The Virgin Mary, whose legend is so meagre, but whose power over the Catholic imagination is
so great, is an even clearer illustration of this inward building up of an ideal form. Everything
is here spontaneous sympathetic expansion of two given events: the incarnation and the crucifixion.
The figure of the Virgin, found in these mighty scenes, is gradually clarified and developed,
until we come to the thought on the one hand of her freedom from original sin, and on the other
to that of her universal maternity. We thus attain the conception of one of the noblest of
conceivable r√¥les and of one of the most beautiful of characters. It is a pity that a foolish
iconoclasm should so long have deprived the Protestant mind of the contemplation of this ideal.
