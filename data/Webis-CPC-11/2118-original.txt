But you must be quite
sure, Stephen, that you have a vocation because it would be terrible if you found afterwards
that you had none. Once a priest always a priest, remember. Your catechism tells you that the
sacrament of Holy Orders is one of those which can be received only once because it imprints
on the soul an indelible spiritual mark which can never be effaced. It is before you must weigh
well, not after. It is a solemn question, Stephen, because on it may depend the salvation of
your eternal soul.
