Twenty-three battles in Cuba was his record with his guns. Once he captured and sentenced to death, but escaped. Later still a steel tipped Mauser bullet pierced his lungs. This healed, but the fever struck him down, and compelled his return to the United States. As he was preparing to return to Cuba the Maine was blown up and in his certainty that war with Spain would result he awaited the issue. Governor Leedy, of Kansas, telegraphed for him, and he became Colonel of the Twentieth Kansas. He went with General Miles to Cuba in June, 1898, and sailed with his regiment for Manila in October. Three weeks before he sailed Colonel Funston met Miss Ella Blankhart of Oakland. As impetuous in love as in war he wooed and won her, the marriage taking place the day before the transport sailed.

Of his daring risks and feats in the Philippines and of his capture of Aguinaldo the general public is so familiar as not to need recapitulation here. Of his qualities as a fighting man pure and simple, there can be no two opinions. Says General Harrison G. Otis; "Funston is the greatest daredevil in the army, and would rather fight than eat. I never saw a man who enjoyed fighting so much." Another friend of his once said that Funston was a sixteenth century hero, born four hundred years or so too late, who had ever since been seeking to remedy the chronological error of his birth. Golden Gate park was the mecca of the destitute. This immense playground of the municipality was converted into a vash mushroom city that bore striking resemblance to the fleeting towns located on the border of a government reservation about to be opened to public settlement. Kitchen utensils that a week before would have been regard with contempt were articles of high value.
