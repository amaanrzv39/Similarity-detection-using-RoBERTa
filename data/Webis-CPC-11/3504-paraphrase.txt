The thought came to me all of a sudden that this would be a great chance to take off with the boat and go free.  The first thing I did was take all the food I could get my hands on.  I told the man we would be far too bold for us to  eat any of the bread that had been left on the boat for the Turk.  The man agreed with me so he brought us a small sack of rice along with some rusks.

I gathered some wine, a big lum of was, a good saw, an axe, a digging spade, rope and any sort of thing that could be of possible use to us while the man was on shore.  Knowing where the Turk's wine case was, while the man was on the sohre I put all of that into the boat.  Being very tricky I gathered all of the things I needed.  I hollered at the young man, "The Turk's guns are over there in the boat, but I couldn't find any shot.  I want you to get some shot because you nkow where they kept it.  It's possible that we will want to shoot a bird or two."  Grabbing a case and a pouch he held everything we could want for our guns.  Putting all of these things into a boat, I set sail out of the port for fishing.

A Northerly or Northwesterly wind began to blow.  This was a bad wind for me.  I knew it had been a Southerly wind that could have made my way for the coast of Spain.  But it didn't matter which way the wind blew, my mind was already made up to head out and leave whatever happened to fate.  Soon, I lowered my fishing lines but took care to have some bad sport.  As soon as the fish bit I didn't want to pull them in for I didn't want the Moor to see them.  I said to him, "This will never do because we aren't going to catch any fish here.  We need to sail on for a bit.
