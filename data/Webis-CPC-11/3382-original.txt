Man has in all ways great
difficulty in maintaining the struggle with nature in these frozen climates. You meet with
few towns in Finland, and those few are very thinly peopled. There is no centre, no emulation,
nothing to say, and very little to do, in a northern Swedish or Russian province, and during
eight months of the year, the whole of animated nature is asleep.

The Emperor Alexander possessed himself of Finland after the treaty of Tilsit, and at a period
when the deranged intellects of the monarch who then reigned in Sweden, Gustavus IV., rendered
him incapable of defending his country. The moral character of this prince was very estimable,
but from his infancy, he had been sensible himself that he could not hold the reins of government.
The Swedes fought in Finland with the greatest courage; but without a warlike chief on the
throne, a nation which is not numerous cannot triumph over a powerful enemy. The Emperor Alexander
became master of Finland by conquest, and by treaties founded on force; but we must do him
the justice to say, that he treated this new province very well, and respected the liberties
she enjoyed. He allowed the Finns all their privileges relative to the raising of taxes and
men; he sent very generous assistance to the towns which had been burnt, and his favors compensated
to a certain extent what the Finns possessed as rights, if free men can ever accede voluntarily
to that sort of exchange.
