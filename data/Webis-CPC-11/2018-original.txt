She has an engaging way with her that can turn even that (at least the more endurable aspects
of it) to favour and prettiness. And in The Land Girl's Love Story (HODDER AND STOUGHTON),
a theme after her own heart, she has given us what is, I think, her best achievement so far.
It is an excellent slight tale of two heroines who took their patriotic turn at the work of
the land army on a Welsh farm, and the adventures, agricultural and (of course) amorous, that
befell them there.
