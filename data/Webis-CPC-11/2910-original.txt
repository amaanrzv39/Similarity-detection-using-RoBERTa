At the same time that we were struggling with the First Corps of Meade's army the divisions
of Rhodes and Early on our left were driving the Eleventh Corps before them. But of the gallant
part they bore in the battle I make no mention, inasmuch as I am not writing a general history,
but only jotting down the things I saw, a small part of which I was.

When the battle had ended and the brigade was standing in line close to the town, Colonel Brockenbrough
and I occupied positions in rear of the line; and near us were Capt. Austin Brockenbrough and
Lt. Addison Hall Crittenden. First one and then the other of these two gallant officers fell
mortally wounded, although no Yankee was in sight. It was the work of sharpshooters concealed
in a large wooden building on our left.
