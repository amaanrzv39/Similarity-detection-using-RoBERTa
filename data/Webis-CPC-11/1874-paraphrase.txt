Many types of Eagles exist, from the Russian and Prussian which have two heads, to the bald Eagle, Osprey/Sea Eagle, and the Golden Eagle.  While the Golden Eagle used to be prevelant in the US, it isn't nearly so much so at this time.  Neither the Eagle nor the genus Falco (smaller species) are edible.  They are fun in sport but not for food.
