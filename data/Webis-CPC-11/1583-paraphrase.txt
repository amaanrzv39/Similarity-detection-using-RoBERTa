Lily, I called it, as I saw it was so white.  Ever since it was small, I had it and didn't put it in a cage.  It learned to eat from my hand.  After School, when I call Lily, it flew from the other pigeons and landed on my shoulders.  Once, I called for Lily, but I did not see Lily come.  I tried to find it in the barn alone.
