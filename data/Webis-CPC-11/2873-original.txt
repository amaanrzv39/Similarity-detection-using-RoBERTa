The common source of the art and ritual of Osiris is the intense,
world-wide desire that the life of Nature which seemed dead should live again. This common
emotional factor it is that makes art and ritual in their beginnings well-nigh indistinguishable.
Both, to begin with, copy an act, but not at first for the sake of the copy. Only when the
emotion dies down and is forgotten does the copy become an end in itself, a mere mimicry.

It is this downward path, this sinking of making to mimicry, that makes us now-a-days think
of ritual as a dull and formal thing. Because a rite has ceased to be believed in, it does
not in the least follow that it will cease to be done. We have to reckon with all the huge
forces of habit.
