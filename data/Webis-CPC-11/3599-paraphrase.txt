THE DECURIO SAW THE LOVERS TILL THEY GONE ON TO THE OUT OF SIGHT;AND CALLED THEM EVEN WHEN THEY DIDNT HEAR HIS WORDS NO LONGER.

HE ENTERED IN TO HIS HOUSE.THE PRAYER BOOK WAS LAID OPEN BECAUSE THE YOUNG GIRL HAD KEPT THE BOOK OPENED.THE OPENED PAGE WAS DAMPED WITH HER TEARS.NUMA'S HAND TREMBLED AS HE KISSED THE VOLUME FERVENTLY AND PLACED IT IN HIS BOSOM

THE NIGHT TIME HAD LAUNCHED THE ROUMIN LAID ON HIS WOLF-SKIN COUCH WHERE THE MAIDEN WHO HAD THE GOLDEN HAIR AND HER LOVER HAD SLEPT ONCE BUT NOW SHE HAD STOLEN HIS REST,HE CANT ABLE TO SLEEP AND HE GO ON WALKING AROUND HIS RUG.HE HAD AN UNWOUNTED FEELING AT HIS HEART.THAT IS NOT HAPPINESS AND NOT SADNESS AND WENT TO A DEEP REVIVE.AT THAT MOMENT HE HEARD SOME SOUND AT AN ODD DISTANCE AND AT THE SAME TIME THE TWO STAR SANK BENETH THE HORIZON.NUMA THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE HAPPY.

THE MOON HAD RISEN HIGH IN HEAVENS WHEN THE DECURIO WAS WAKEN FROM HIS SLEEP BY HEAVY FOOTSTEPS.
