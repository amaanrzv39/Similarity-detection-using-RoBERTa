The man chosen as chairman of the Athletic Department was Mr. Walter Camp. His title was General Commissioner of Athletics for the U.S. Navy. At Yale for thirty years, he had been the driving force, strategist, advisor, and organizer of athletics at that institution.

Mr. Camp took up his duties in the midsummer of 1917, only three months after the U.S. had declared war. The Navy's plan was to station one hundred thousand men in each naval district before the end of the year. This quota was quickly being met, and Mr. Camp was called upon to organize recreational activities and sports at these stations. He was able to accomplish these tasks relying on his experience. flexibility, and aptitude.

The navy recruits found themselves in a new and confusing environment. Coming from varied backgrounds, wealthy, working class, college educated and factory workers alike found themselves stationed in facilities that were incomplete and unfamiliar. Although they were restless and uncomfortable, they gamely and patiently reconciled to these conditions.

Many of these young and patriotic Americans, suffering from homesickness also had to deal with the absence of entertainment, the simple comforts of home and lack of recreational sports. The Navy Commission's work and especially the contributions of Mr. Camp in the areas of physical training and mental stimulation were vital and timely under these conditions.
