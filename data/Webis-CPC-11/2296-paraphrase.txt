For two weeks at Tuskegee the regular Farmers' Short Course is offered.  The ccounty schools are closed for this period of time so that the teachers and students are able to attend.  This is also a great opportunity for fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters to sit side by side in a classroom and receive class instruction in raising, canning, poultry raising, and farming.  There is also courses offered for women and girls in the care of children and housekeeping.
