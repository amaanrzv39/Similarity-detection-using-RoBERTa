The Detroit River runs along the city of the same name for approximately 10 miles.  A beautiful river, waters crystal clear, is about 1/2 mile wide and 30-40 feet deep.  There are several islands formed along this stretch of the river which have become summertime attractions for the local population.  The city also claims a 3 mile stretch of a tributary of the Detroit river, called the Rouge. When the great fire of 1805 destroyed the city, the streets were narrow and dirty.  But Augustus B. Woodward (c. 1775-1827), a territorial judge and an admirer of the city of Washington's plan, convinced the Detroit city planners adopt a similar layout by having all streets, some as wide as 100-200 feet, branch out from two hubs not unlike wheel spokes.
