There were small boats darting here and there, amoung the incessant waves. Signal Flags were waving from mast to mast, calling out from ship to ship across the distance.

Every naval officer from the entire fleet and shore were gather on the deck of the largest battleship. All eyes were fixed on the shoreline waiting. Suddenly a series of sharp shots rang out signaling the approach of the ship they had been waiting for. A sharp thin craft eased gracefully across the open water, and pulled up gracefully next to the flag ship. It was the Mayflower the President's yacht. A small boat was lowered overside, and sent to the yacht. A ladder was lowered from the yacht, and President Woodrow Wilson, made his way down to the little boat.
