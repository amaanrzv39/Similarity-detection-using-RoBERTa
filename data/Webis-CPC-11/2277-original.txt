These unhappy men were liberated from confinement about the same
time, and both returned to Oxford. They seemed to have recovered their reasoning faculties,
but the result showed that this was very far from being the case; for, happening to meet on
the banks of the Cherwell, they attacked each other with such fury, that, like Brutus and Aruns,
they were both killed on the spot,--the barber having been burked in the encounter, and the
student having died of a wound which he received in the throat by his antagonist's razor.--Fraser's
Magazine.
