Let me say to you here: when a man in the silence of the night, meditates upon the causes of
enticement for woman, when he finds them in her education and, putting aside personal observation,
for the sake of expressing his thoughts, matures them at the sources I have indicated, not
allowing himself to use his pen except from inspiration of Bossuet and Massillon, permit me
to ask you if there is a word to express my surprise, my grief, on seeing this man dragged
into Court--on account of some passages in his book, and precisely for the truest and most
elevated ideas that he was able to bring together! And I pray you not to forget this in relation
to the charge of outrage against religious morals! And then, if you will permit me, I will
put in opposition to all this, under your very eyes, what I myself call attacking the moral,
that is to say, satisfaction of the senses without bitterness, without those large drops of
cold sweat which fall from the brow of those who give themselves over to it; and I will not
quote to you from licentious books in which the authors have sought to arouse the senses; I
will quote from only one book--which is given as a prize in colleges, but whose author's name
I ask leave to withhold until after I have read you a passage from it. Here is the passage:
I will ask you to pass the volume. It is a copy that was given to a college student as a prize.
I prefer you to take this copy rather than M. Flaubert's:

"The next day I was received into her apartment. There I felt all that voluptuousness carries
with it. The room was filled with the most agreeable perfumes. She lay upon a bed which was
enclosed in garlands of flowers. She appeared to be lying there languishingly. She extended
her hand to me and made me sit beside her.
