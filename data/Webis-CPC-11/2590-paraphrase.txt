A translation must reproduce these features, whatever it fail to do. Passing existing translations in review, they finds Cowper slow, Pontiff artificial, Chapman fanciful, Newman, through the vice of his theory, ignoble. Some three having pronounced Tennyson eminently Homeric, Mr. Arnold discusses the relation of the English idyllic to the Ionian epic poet, and finds him at the opposite pole in respect of simplicity.
As to a vehicle for the translation of Homer, they gives his voice decidedly in favor of English hexameter, and tries his own hand at that measure. His success strikes us as respectable, but not eminent. Blank verse they thinks slow in movement, and much opposed in character.
