It is sometimes said, that, if the Democratic party should resume the rule of this nation,
the Confederates, or Rebels, would signify their readiness to return into the Union, on the
simple condition that things should be allowed to assume the forms they bore prior to Mr. Lincoln's
election. They rebelled against the men who came into power through the political decision
that was made in 1860; and, the American people having reversed that decision by restoring
the Democracy, the cause of their rebellion having been removed, rebellion itself would cease
as of course. Were this view of the subject indisputably sound, it would ill become the American
to surrender to the men who assume that the decision of an election, this way or that, affords
sufficient reason for a resort to arms.
