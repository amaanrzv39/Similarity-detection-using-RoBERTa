CLASS III.--THE RED ALGÆ (Rhodophyceæ).

These are among the most beautiful and interesting members of the plant kingdom, both on account
of their beautiful colors and the exquisitely graceful forms exhibited by many of them. Unfortunately
for inland students they are, with few exceptions, confined to salt water, and consequently
fresh material is not available. Nevertheless, enough can be done with dried material to get
a good idea of their general appearance, and the fruiting plants can be readily preserved in
strong alcohol.
