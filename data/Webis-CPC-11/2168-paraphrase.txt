4. Education

There are ways to gain knowledge other than
via experiment.  One way is via education:
rather than directly learning via experiments,
one can learn indirectly via others.
By using this method to pass the experience and 
experimental results from the race to the
newcomers, there will less experimentation needed,
since education will transmit most of what will
need to be known.
