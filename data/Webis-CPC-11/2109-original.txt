If it was on the off, that was no reason why I should not bang it
to square-leg, a stroke which has become fashionable since my time, but in those old days,
you did not often see it in first-class Cricket. It was rather regarded as "an agrarian outrage."
Foreigners and ladies would find Cricket a more buoyant diversion if all the world, and especially
LEWIS HALL and SHREWSBURY, played on my principles. Innings would not last so long. Not so
many matches would be drawn. The fielders would not catch cold.
