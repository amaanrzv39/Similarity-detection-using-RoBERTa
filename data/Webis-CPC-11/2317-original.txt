As our gymnasia are usually private, and only moderately frequented,
the gymnast is not stimulated to those exertions which society and competition would arouse.
Ennui often mars his enjoyment. We have seen men methodically pursuing, day after day, the
same exercises, with all the listless drudgery of a hack-horse. Geniality and generous emulation
are among the great benefits of the true gymnasium.

"But how shall I find time to follow out even one of these exercises?" objects the victim of
American social life.
