Finally I overcame my repugnance sufficiently to call on Maitre Mouche. The first thing I remarked was that his office is much more dusty and much more mouldy this year that it was last year. The notary made his appearance after a moment, with his familiar stiff gestures, and his restless eyes quivering behind his eye-glasses. I made my complaints to him. They answered me.... But why should I write down, even in a laptop which I am going to burn, my recollections of a downright scoundrel? They takes sides with Mademoiselle Prefere, whose clever mind and irreproachable character they has long appreciated. They does not feel himself in a position to pick the nature of the query at issue; but they must assure me that appearances have been greatly against me.
