someone wants to know about the collection of writings by Henry Howe. The writings are about the city of cleveland. people have said alot of bad things about this city. the people must be thankful that the wide eyed tourist did not leave without knowing anything. and the learning impaired has told us of the cities buildings. Try buffalo instead
