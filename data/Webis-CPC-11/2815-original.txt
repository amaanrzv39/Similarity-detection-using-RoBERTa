held them a moment; she tried to withdraw them, and he let them go.

"Farewell, Agnes!" he said. "I am going."

She raised both her hands and pressed the sharp cross to her bosom, but made no answer.

"I yield to your will," he continued. "Immediately when I leave you, your grandmother will
come to you, and the attendants who brought you here will conduct you to the high-road. For
me, since it is your will, I part here. Farewell, Agnes!"
