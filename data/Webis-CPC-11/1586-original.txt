It is melancholy to observe how many
lives have been broken down, ruined or corrupted in attempts to realise some supreme and unattainable
desire; through the impulse of overmastering passion, of powerful and perhaps irresistible
temptation. It is still sadder to observe how large a proportion of the failures of life may
be ultimately traced to the most insignificant causes and might have been avoided without any
serious effort either of intellect or will.
