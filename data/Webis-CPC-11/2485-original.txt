On the contrary,
England will find it advantageous to come to us for our anthracite. A slow radiating fire without
flame is what is required, and this is best supplied by our anthracite. The Ericsson will be
ready for sea by October next, and her owners intend to take passengers at a reduced price,

VIOLETS:

SENT IN A TINY BOX.

    Let them lie--ah, let them lie!
      Plucked flowers--dead to-morrow;
    Lift the lid up quietly,
    As you'd lift the mystery
      Of a buried sorrow.

    Let them lie--the fragrant things,
      All their souls thus giving;
    Let no breeze's ambient wings
    And no useless water-springs
      Mock them into living.
