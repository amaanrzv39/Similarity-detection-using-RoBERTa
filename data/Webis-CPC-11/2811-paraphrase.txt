In September 1819, John Gird had a note endorsed for $4,100 by Isaac Entwistle, and mortgaged some of his private possessions which were registered as "one chronometer, one sideboard, two mahogany dining desks, two tea ditto, one couple small discern desks, one assistant, two bureaus, one drafting office desk, one dozen dash foundation armchairs, one ditto with settee to correspond, one settee, two looking glass utensils, carpets, brass andirons, two fenders, shovel, tongs, window curtains, three bedsteads and beds, armchair, bathe stand, box with a seal, home linen, one set gilt tea chinaware, four waiters, one half dozen bright teaspoons, one set plated castors, sundry glass and earthen ware, kitchen furnishings, etc."[121]

Six years afterwards this obligation was not clarified up and John Gird sheltered the obligation with his home and lot.
