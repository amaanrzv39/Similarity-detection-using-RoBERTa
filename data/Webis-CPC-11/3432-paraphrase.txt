These article is provided for carbon packing systems(Fig.12), which consists of blocks of carbon in sets in a packing case bolted to the top head of wheel case.There are three sets of blocks,and each set is made of two rings of thre segments each.
one ring of segments breaks joints with it made in the case and each set is seperated from othersbya flangein the case in which it is fitted.In some cases the packing is kept from turningby means of link one end of which is fastened to the case and the other to the packing holder.sometimes light springs are used to hold the packing against the shaftand in some cases pressure of steam do that.
There is also pipe shown in the (fig.12),leading from the mainline to the packing case ,the pressure in the pipe ha been reduced.The space  between the two upper sets of rings is drained to the third stage by means of three-way cock, which keeps the balance between the atmosphere and packing case pressure.the carbon ring are fitted to the shaft with a slight clearence to start with and very soon get a smooth finish, which is not practically steam-tight but frictionless.
the carbon ring shown in ( fiig.12) is the older desidn.the segments are held against the flat bearing surfaceof the case by spiral springs set in brass ferrules.the circle is held together by bronze strap screwed and drawn togetherat the ends by springs.still othere springs press the strapsagainst the surface upon which the carbon bears, cuttingoff leaks through joints and across horinztal surfaces of carbon.the whole ring is prevented from turning by the connecting -rod which engages a pin in the hole , provided for the springs.
