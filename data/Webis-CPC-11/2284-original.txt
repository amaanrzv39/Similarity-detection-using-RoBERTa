THE AMERICA instruments are constructed on the same principle and many of them are equally
perfect.  Mr. Edward Anthony of 205 Broadway, New York city, has constructed, and sold cameras
fully equal to the German and for which Voitlander instruments have been refused in exchange
by the purchaser.

The ordinary camera box (see fig. 5, a) varies in size to suit the tube, and is termed medium,
half, or whole.  Within the box is a slide to assist in regulating the focus, and in enlarging
or diminishing the picture.
