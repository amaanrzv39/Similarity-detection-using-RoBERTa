Churches used organs in the fourth century. Organs were introduced by Archbishop Theodore into England. There were no official organists back then. The master chorister or choir gentlemen took on the duty of playing the organ. The monks played in the churches of regular foundation.

English Church music started in the Reformation. The great mind of Palestrina had created a revolution as it relates to the traditional form of music, and the names of Tallis, Merbecke, Byrd and Farret are associated with the English Liturgy of the early days. There is also a great list of successors that extend down to today, and there is no falling off.
