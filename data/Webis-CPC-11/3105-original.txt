'There's a widow and her daughter and son-in-law, with three children, in the back-room,' answered
Mr Harker. 'I believe the women go out charring, and the man's a bricklayer. In the front,
there's a man called Glegg and his daughter. I fancy they're people that have been better off
at some time of their lives. He has been a tradesman--a cooper, he tells me; but things went
badly with him; and since he came here, his wife died of the fever, and he's been so weakly
ever since he had it, that he can earn nothing. His daughter lives by her needle.'

Mary was out; she had gone to take home some work, in hopes of getting immediate payment for
it. A couple of shillings would purchase them coal and food, and they were much in need of
both.
