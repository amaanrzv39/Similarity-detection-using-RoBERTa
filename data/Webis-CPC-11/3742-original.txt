Her clear intellect, her positive
convictions, her boundless energy, and her ardent enthusiasm, gave her a powerful influence
in those early days of the Revolution, that looked towards a world reconstructed but not plunged
into the dark depths of chaos, and it is through this that she has left a name among the noted
women of France. In more peaceful times her peculiar talent would doubtless have led her towards
literature. In her best style she has rare vigor and simplicity. She has moments of eloquent
thought. There are flashes of it in her early letters to Sophie, which she begs her friend
not to burn, though she does not hope to rival Mme. de Sevigne, whom she takes for her model.
She lacked the grace, the lightness, the wit, the humor of this model, but she had an earnestness,
a serious depth of thought, that one does not find in Mme. de Sevigne. She had also a vein
of sentiment that was an underlying force in her character, though it was always subject to
her masculine intellect. She confesses that she should like to be the annalist of her country,
and longs for the pen of Tacitus, for whom she has a veritable passion. When one reads her
sharp, incisive pen-portraits, drawn with such profound insight and masterly skill, one feels
that her true vocation was in the world of letters. At the close she verges a little upon the
theatrical, as sometimes in her young days. But when she wrote her final records she felt her
last hours slipping away. Life, with its large possibilities undeveloped and its promises unfulfilled,
was behind her. Darkness was all around her, eternal silence before her. And she had lived
but thirty-nine years.

Mme. Roland does not really belong to the world of the salons, though she has been included
among them by some of her own cotemporaries.
