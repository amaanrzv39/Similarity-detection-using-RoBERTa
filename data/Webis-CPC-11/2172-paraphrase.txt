I said: "I'll go to my aunt's house next vacation
and learn how we became mighty.  I'll also
find out exactly why we don't currently practice our inherited claims to glory." 

In Snowborough, Aunt Patience was anxious
to give me the proof I desperately longed for. 
But she told me that all the old family documents and letters were burned in a fire in '98.  There 
was no proof of our nobility in Snowborough or 
anywhere else.
