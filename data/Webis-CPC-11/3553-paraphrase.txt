In that beautiful carved oak chest that is standing on the upstairs landing, I would place all of her very best clothing and lock it up and throw away the key into the sea; and little Annie being the most gentle little girl would allow me to do so. However, if I ever had the nerve to negatively critacize Cartherine's clothes, she would have cast me in the sea.

April 7 -- This was a very wet bank holiday. Favorable weather never occurs on the feast of St. Lubbock. Obviously the Saints of old hold a grudge against the newest calendar additon. It is probably very nasty in town, with the shops being closed and the wet streets. It must have been very sad for Paterfamilias, who in order to catch an early train, got out of bed at seven and left with his wife, kids, and food basket. But all the sadder for the one who has not a thing in the world to do all day but struggle through twelve hours of human pleasure, and has no train to catch!

The influence of St. Lubbock's ill will is not extended down here luckily, where things appear to operate like run down clockwork. I strolled over the opposite fields. In the second meadow there were several new young lambs. The rain did not bother them, although they were suckling hungrily from their mothers, with their small legs tucked underneath them, their tails wagging.

One ewe was lying down on it's side. The lamb standing by, stared at the ewe with a quiet interest coming from her white-lashed, ignorant, brown eyes.
