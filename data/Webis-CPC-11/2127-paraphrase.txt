Gilbert White was a fellow of Oriel College for more than fifty years, and some years since has been offered to have a portrait of him painted for their hall. An inquiry was made of all the member of his family; but no real portrait of any such description could be found. My grandfather, Thomas White whom is Gilbert White's brother pressed him to have his portrait painted. According to my father, i have heard him talk about this and said that Gilbert White talked about having his portrait painted but  but it was never done.
