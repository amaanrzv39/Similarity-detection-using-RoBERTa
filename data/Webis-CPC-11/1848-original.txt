Prince Repnin, though of
the Greek church, which abounds in forms and ceremonies, and in fasts exceeds all others, had
so little regard for the forms of his religion, that he ordered a play to be acted on Ash Wednesday
at Warsaw. Towards Christmas 1767, Lord Malmesbury, then Mr Harris, was at the house of a Polish
nobleman in the hunting season. He observed to the king that he had never seen him in better
spirits. "Ah!" was the royal answer, "it is very pleasant to delude one's self sometimes."
