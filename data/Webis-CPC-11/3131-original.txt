The flowers on the slopes above Prato are wonderful, and the village is full of nice bits for
sketching, but the best thing, to my fancy, is the church, and the way it stands, and the lovely
covered porch through which it is entered.  This porch is not striking from the outside, but
I took two sketches of it from within.  There is, also, a fresco, half finished, of St. George
and the Dragon, probably of the fifteenth century, and not without feeling.  There is not much
inside the church, which is modernised and more recent than the tower.  The tower is very good,
and only second, if second, in the upper Leventina to that of Quinto, which, however, is not
nearly so well placed.

The people of Prato are just as fond of cherries as those of Primadengo, but I did not see
any men in the trees.
