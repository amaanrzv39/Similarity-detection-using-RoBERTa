As a people, they are not active-minded nor industrious, but yield to the influence of climate,
and, following the example offered to them by the vast, dense jungle on every side, accept
life as easily as it comes. They are no exception to the rule that all untutored minds, living
in constant communion with any awful aspect of Nature, be it gigantic mountains, a waste of
waters, or an illimitable jungle, are saturated with superstitions; every pool, every tree,
every rock is the home of an evil spirit, and all mysterious noises in the forest are ghostly
whisperings. Everywhere are signs and omens to warn man of danger or direct his course; theirs
is a life where no schooling is so vital as the ability to read aright the "sermons in stones,
books in the running brooks." For them the world is the patch of jungle covering the few square
miles that they know, and bounded by the hills in the distance; seldom do they get an extended
view of the surrounding country; trees hem them in on all sides and the mountains are so difficult
of ascent, and furthermore so infested with demons or "antu," that the summits can be gained
only at the risk of body, and, still worse, of soul.

Many natives of the interior live and die with never a glimpse of the sea, and the tales which
the Malay and Chinese traders tell of lands beyond the horizon where white men live, are as
incomprehensible to them as are to us the conjectural accounts which astronomers give of the
canals on the planet Mars.
