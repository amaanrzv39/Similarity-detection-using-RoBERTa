My favorite poems are Christabel and Kubla-Khan; The Skylark, The Cloud and The Eve of Saint Agnes and The Nightingale; certain of the Nocturnes.  They are just the essence of what poetry is supposed to be for me.

Shelley uses rich and remarkable diction for the most part in much of his work, but in these poems, it doesn't come across as such, rather it does not obtrude itself at all.  It is not noticeable.  He is inspired by Echo, whose body has dissolved from about her voice.
