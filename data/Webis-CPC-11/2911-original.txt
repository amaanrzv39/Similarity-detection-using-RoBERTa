And as both she and Avery before long fell cheerfully in love
with other persons I suppose the move could so far be counted a success. Before, however, the
divorce facilities of the land of freedom could bring the tale to one happy ending an accident
to Cecily's motor and the long arm that delivered her to her husband's professional care brought
it to another. I am left wondering how this d√©nouement would have been affected if Avery had
been, say, a dentist, or of any other calling than the one that so obviously loaded the dice
in his favour. I repeat, however, a distinctly well-written and human story, almost startlingly
topical too in one place, where Dr. Avery observes, "There's a lot of grippe in town, and it's
a thing that isn't reported to the Health Department."
