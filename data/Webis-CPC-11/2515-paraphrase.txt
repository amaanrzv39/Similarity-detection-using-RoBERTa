Even Though I was shocked, it was not enough to stop me from enjoying the views. We went to the usual places and eventually, the fact that police were tailing us stopped being a bother. However the ordeal had caused me to see things as through a dark veil. I wanted to be away from a place where force was the only policy. We finally recieved our papers back, of course they appologised for our detention and the scrutiny they had used with us. It seemed that not being cautious at verona got us into that mess. we left venice quickly after. Being safely back on englands shores, we decided not to venture out much anymore.
