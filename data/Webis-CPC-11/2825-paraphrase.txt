Slovenliness is the most accurate word to describe Maria (Hutchinson), the latest heroine of the Baroness Von Hutten. Maria carries with her the aura of being contracted for, while that perfectionistic supervisor who is over the shoulder of every craftman who works honestly, critical of every phase, readjusting the other faulty construction piece, has basically left the contractor. Maria was a daughter born from an artist named Drello, friend of the great and seller of autograph letters. He was able to live comfortably off of his work. Maria's sibling was a rather dull brother of the name Laertes, who stumbled upon a highness who fell head over heels in love with Maria and was dishonorable in his promises.
