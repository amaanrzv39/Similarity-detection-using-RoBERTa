Very pleasing is the Hotel des Messageries, here as well as the primitive areas discussed before, you are not taken as a foreigner, but as a guest to be fussed over. This delightful dispositon, posessed by all classes, will most likely become the much talked about gossip, that can become tiresome. The best speakers in the world, I truly think, are the Franc-Comtois, and any chance listener to the conversation will not get away with ease.
