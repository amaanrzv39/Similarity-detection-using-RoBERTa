In the skull of the more improved and civilized
nations among the woolly-haired blacks of Africa, there is comparatively slight deviation from
the form which may be looked upon as the common type of the human head. We are assured, for
example, by M. Golberry, that the Ioloffs, whose colour is a deep transparent black, and who
have woolly hair, are robust and well made, and have regular features. Their countenances,
he says, are ingenuous, and inspire confidence: they are honest, hospitable, generous, and
faithful. The women are mild, very pretty, well made, and of agreeable manners. On the other
side of the equinoctial line, the Congo Negroes, as Pigafetta declares, have not thick lips
or ugly features; except in colour they are very like the Portuguese.
