Immediately obvious was that magnitude of the the service Churchill performed for the Prince of Orange.  Churchhill had barely settled at William's headquarters, when he was dispatched to London to take command of the Horse Guards.  It was there, on December 20, 1688, that he signed the famous Act of Association showing favor for the Prince of Orange.  Shortly, he was appointed lieutenant-general of William's armies, where he quickly reorganized the troops under officers whom he could trust would be loyal to William.  This served the Prince well, as he was soon seated on an unstable throne.  
Churchill was present while the House of Peers debated the question of whom should take the crown.  He at first indicated an inclination to a regency, but cleverly managed to absent himself on the night of the decisive vote.  He later voted, on February 6th to settle the crown on William and Mary, and under his new title as Earl of Marlborough, he assisted at their coronation.  
Having settled the accession of the monarchy, England now joined the continental league against France, where marlborough was given command of the British auxiliary force in the Netherlands.  With courage and ability, he proved remarkable in the victory of Walcourt.
