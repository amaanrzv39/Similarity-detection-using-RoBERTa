Plants are not known to have medicinal properties, therefore it must be related to minerals somehow.  After all, everybody accepts the healing properties of gemstones, minerals, and metals.  Metals with known medicinal value are antimony, lead, iron, mercury, and copper which ranks above the others in this category.

van Helmont described the healing properties of Butler's stone and other alcohol-based concoctions as "drif" meaning natural. These properties can only come from a metal source as corroborated by Porta's Natural Magick.
