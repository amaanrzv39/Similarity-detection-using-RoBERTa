Bob went with him, and after a trip through Italy, they arrived at Barbizon to see the scene
of "The Angelus," and look upon the land of Millet--Millet, whom Michael Rossetti called "The
Whitman of Art."

Bob was an artist: he could paint, write, and play the flageolet. Robert Louis declared that
his own particular velvet jacket and big coat would save him at Barbizon, even if he could
not draw any to speak of. "In art the main thing is to look the part--or else paint superbly
well," said Robert Louis.
