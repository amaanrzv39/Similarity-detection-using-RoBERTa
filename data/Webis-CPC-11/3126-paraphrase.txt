The fully functional youth, fresh in mind and unbiased towards the world, needs the capacity to carry the heartiest of materials: The earth, the sand, the clay, the rocks, like Sisyphus towards the apex of the hill. What use would he have with the dainty and polite variety of carts? He has no need for dwelling on its contours, its shades, and delicately maneuvering it along the parquet, aware of its immobility and the danger confronting the tiny couple in its cabin as their carriage is fit for show and not motion. Such will induce him simply to redirect his game, to unbridling and setting loose statuesque horses, to ridding them of their mane and tail in the act of smoothing their
frays.
