But two powerfully built and fearless men, David English, of Hameringham, and a
gamekeeper named Bullivant, were set to accomplish the task, and they succeeded in running
their man to ground, and securing him at “The Bungalow,” a public-house on the Witham, near
Boston. {24}  With them was hanged another noted character known as “Bill” Clarke, convicted
of sheep-stealing.  His was the last case of hanging for that offence.  The last of the gang
was not captured till two years later.
