Paine felt that he had made one Republic with a pamphlet, why not another? He had the unlimited
faith of his generation in the efficacy of argument, and experience had proved his power. As
Carlyle, in his whimsical dramatic fashion, said of him, "He can and will free all this world;
perhaps even the other." Godwin, as became the philosopher of the movement, set his hopes on
the slower working of education: to make men wise was to make them free. Paine was the pamphleteer
of the human camp.
