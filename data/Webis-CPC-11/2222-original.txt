Sometimes Aunt Pen found a doctor, or a medicine, or a course of diet, or something,
that gave her great sensations of relief, and then she would come down, and go about the house,
and praise our administration, and say every thing went twice as far as it used to go before
we came, and tell us delightful stories, of our mother's housewifely skill, and be quite herself
again; and she would make the table ring with laughing, and give charming little tea-parties;
and then we all did wish that Aunt Pen would live forever--and be down-stairs.
