By summer moonlight it must be wonderful.

We descended at a sharp pace, all the way through a forest of chestnuts, the fruit already
gathered, the golden leaves rustling in their fall. At the foot lies the village of San Fili,
and here we left the crazy old cart which we had dragged so far. A little further, and before
us lay a long, level road, a true Roman highway, straight for mile after mile. By this road
the Visigoths must have marched after the sack of Rome.
