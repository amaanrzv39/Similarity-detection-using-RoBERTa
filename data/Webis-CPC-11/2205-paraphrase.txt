The increase in sailing recruits was largely due to monopoly.  Elizabeth, for example, would grant Sir Walter Raleigh the charge of creating a monopoly on wine.  Raleigh would attempt to bring in as much wine as could be imported and Elizabeth would agree, as she got the tax on the wine.  Thus, crews would be sought for these trading vessels.  Equally, crews would also be sought for the vessels of smugglers, who would often import the same products as the monopolists, but at less legal, far lower prices.
