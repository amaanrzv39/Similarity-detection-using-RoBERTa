man of the world, the courtier and the wit, the favourite of the tyrant Dionysius; it fits
in well enough with a life of genial self-indulgence; it always reappears whenever a man has
reconciled himself 'to roll with pleasure in a sensual sty.'  But life is not always, nor for
most persons at any time, a thing of ease and soft enchantments, and the Cyrenaic philosophy
must remain for the general work-a-day world a stale exotic.
