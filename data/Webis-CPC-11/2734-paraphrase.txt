He is accused with having made a yield of his prodigious reputation and repute, by discreditably and unconscientiously accepting payments from customers for services which he well knew at the time that he could not perhaps render to them; in short, with taking notes in instances to which he had no rational expect of being competent to attend. This is a very dangerous accusation, and demands a intentional and honourable examination.
