The as yet unequaled population boom which occured in the first portion of the 1800's was replaced with an increasing drop in the birth-rate. This will begin to have a marked effect on social conditions, especially given that the heretofore deecreasing death rate will soon table. With this anticipated stagnant population level, Europe will enjoy much better conditions, and the hope of tackling social reform issues will meet with greater chances for success. Instead of desperately competing and fighting, the population will resume traditional enjoyment of the finer things in life. Once again, people's lives will be valued, and humans will reserve their praise for the peacemakers over the warmongers.
