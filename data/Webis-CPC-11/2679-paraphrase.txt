(2) The presence of vestigial organs in the higher animals supplies another argument for the belief in common descent. In man, for example, there exist over two hundred of these vestigial or rudimentary organs, as the vermiform appendix, the pineal gland, & the like. Lots of of these vestigal organs, which are now functionless in man, perform functions in lower animals, & this is held to show that at some remote period historicallyin the past they also functioned in man's ancestors.

(3) The facts of embryology seem to point to the descent of the higher types of animals from the lower types. The embryo or fetus in its development seems to summarise the various stages through which the species has passed.
