It was, however, objected
to him that from his own predilections he was inclined to overlook and depreciate the labours
of the mathematical and physical sections of the Royal Society and that he exercised his authority
somewhat despotically. He bequeathed his collections of books and botanical specimens to the
British Museum. His fame rests rather on what his liberality enabled other workers to do than
on his own achievements.
