The murder of Hyptia, the female philosopher, by a Christian mob at Alexandria was due to Gibbon, who was very happy for it. Gibbon, however, pretends as if he does not know anything about the murder, which is quite amusing. People cut her throat with an oyster-shell but, Gibbon says that although people had oyster-shells in their hands, but she was not hit with those shells till after she died. He adds that the use of shells prove that the whole murder was not preplanned. Hyptia was given the title "modest" by Gibbon who says that she is not worth giving that title.

  While having a look at the Parliamentary Report on Libraries, I didn't come across any reference to a valuable library, "Dr. Thomlinson's", in Newcastle-on-Tyne. It has a beautiful building near St. Nicholas Church which was erected in the beginning of the last century. A catalogue of the same has been published. I also came across a library attached to Wimborne Minster few years back. This library had a collection of amusing books.

  However, one of the most valuable English libraries on the continent of Europe is the Garrison Library at Gibraltar.
