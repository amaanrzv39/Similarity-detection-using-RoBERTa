We need not wonder that volumes might be filled with recitals of cruelties and atrocities
of torture, ending, in many cases, only with the death of the victim. Nor need we wonder at
the more loathsome moral abominations so prevalent in Southern society, which degrade the whites
even more than the blacks--of children begotten by masters upon the persons of their slave
women--begotten in lust and sold for gain; of beautiful quadroons and octoroons sought and
bought for the base pleasure of their owners; of families, where the lawful wives and daughters
of the master are served by slaves that are their own uncles, brothers, or sisters, born of
slave women, yielding to the master's lustful will. Amalgamation is a Southern, not a Northern
taste and practice.
