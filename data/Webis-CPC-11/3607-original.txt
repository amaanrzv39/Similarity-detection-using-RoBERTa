Here there is at present nothing with which to undertake any enterprise,
unless your Majesty is pleased that some village be given them as an encomienda, in order that
from the tributes may be obtained means to defray the necessary expenses, and conduct the public
business in such manner as your Majesty shall order. With that they will be well content. The
governor despatched a soldier to Maluco to ascertain what conclusion the Portuguese of those
islands had reached. He returned almost at the same time as the ship from Nueba España, with
the news which the governor will write to your Majesty. This news gave great satisfaction to
all the people of these islands, because your Majesty's interests are thereby promoted, since
our Lord has placed in your Majesty's hands the spice-trade of Maluco, which your ancestors
so greatly desired. I am sending the letter which the captain at Maluco wrote me, in order
that it may please your Majesty to reward generously so worthy a Portuguese as this man is--who
certainly has displayed great zeal in your Majesty's service--not forgetting him who obtained
and bore the news. This is Ensign Francisco de Dueñas, a very intelligent man, and very reliable
in his own duties, who by his energy and diligence succeeded with this undertaking, in which
others had failed. He is an old soldier in these islands, and has served your Majesty well
in times of war. He is loved by all in this city, and has a good reputation on account of his
excellent qualities.
