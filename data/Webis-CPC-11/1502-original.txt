On thy bosom, Royal River, silent
sped the birch canoe, Bearing brave with bow and quiver, on his way to war or woo; Now with
flaunting flags and streamers--mighty monsters of the deep-- Lo the puffing, panting steamers,
through thy foaming waters sweep; And behold the grain-fields golden, where the bison grazed
of eld; See the fanes of forests olden by the ruthless Saxon felled,-- Plumed pines that spread
their shadows ere Columbus spread his sails.
