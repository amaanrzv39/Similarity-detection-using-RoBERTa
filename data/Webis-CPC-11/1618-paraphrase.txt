It is notof a common thing that a being like Emilia should ever inspire love. 
The Mort de Cesar ends with the speech of Antony over the dead body of Caesar. It is truely a tragedy with no conclusion that was borrowed from Shakspeare. It seemed as if all the parts were patched together. The conspiracy was just so "coarse-spun" and hurried. How stupid Caesar must have been, he allowed the conspirators to brave him right under his nose. He didn't even see it comming!
