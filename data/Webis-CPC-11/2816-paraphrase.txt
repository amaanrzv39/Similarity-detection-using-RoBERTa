Author John Banim wrote The Denounced, The Mayor of Windgap, The Ghost Hunter, and The Smuggler, all of which the critics really liked. When he hit on financial hard times, John Sterling, a guy who worked for the Times and really liked Banim's work, along with the help from other literary people, helped him get a pension from the government in 1836 that took care of him for the rest of his life. He died handicapped and wheelchair-bound in Ireland on August 13th, 1842, in Windgap Cottage, a short drive away from Kilkenny.
