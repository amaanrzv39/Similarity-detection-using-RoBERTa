CELTIC LANGUAGE.--As fraus latet in generalibus in linguistics as in law, I beg to suggest
that, instead of using the word Celtic, the words Gaelic, Cymbric, Breton, Armorican, Welsh,
Irish, &c. might be properly appropriated. The mother Celtic is lost,--her remains are to be
found only in the names of mountains, rivers, and countries; and our knowledge of this tongue
is derived from an acquaintance with her two principal daughters, the Gaelic and Cymbric (=Kymric).
The Gaelic tongue has been driven by Germanic invasion into Ireland (Erse), and into the Highlands
of Scotland (Gaelic). The Cymbric tongue first took refuge in Belgium, known afterwards as
Breton, and still lives as Welsh and Bas-Breton, which (and not the Gaelic) is nearest of kin
in some words to the Latin and Italian.

To understand this subject, the profound induction of Eichhoff must be studied carefully.

Illustration of Longfellow--"God's Acre."--Longfellow's very beautiful little poem, commencing:

 "I like that ancient Saxon phrase, which calls
    The burial-ground God's acre."

is doubtless familiar to all your readers. It may interest some of them to know, that the "ancient
Saxon phrase" has not yet become obsolete. I read the words "GOTTES ACKER," when at Basle last
autumn, inscribed over the entrance to a modern cemetery, just outside the St. Paul's Gate
of that city.
