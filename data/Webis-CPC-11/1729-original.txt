Batter should be thin enough to run thru a funnel. Drop from funnel into deep, hot fat (375-f).
Spirals and endless intricate shapes can be made by swirling and criss-crossing while controlling
the funnel spout with a finger. Serve hot with molasses, tart jelly, jam or sprinkle with powdered
sugar. Add shortening, fold in the stiffly beaten egg whites. Turn into greased 9 inch square
pan and bake in moderate oven (350-f) about 30 minutes. Cut into 3 inch squares.
