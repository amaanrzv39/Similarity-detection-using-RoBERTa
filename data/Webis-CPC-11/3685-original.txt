A few days were
spent in the preparations necessary for an assault. When all was ready, orders were given:
the column marched forward at midnight. At that moment a courier rode up at full speed with
dispatches from Potemkin. Suwarrow was no sooner apprised of his arrival than he guessed with
his usual quickness the nature of the dispatches, and he determined not to receive them till
the fate of the enterprise was decided. He ordered his horse to be brought round to the door
of his tent; he sprang on it and galloped off, without seeming to observe the courier. After
a desperate resistance the Turks at length gave way, and Ismail fell into the hands of the
Russians. With his staff gathered eagerly round Suwarrow to offer their congratulations, the
eyes of the Marshal fell upon the officer who bore the dispatches.

"Who are you, brother?" said he.

"It is I," replied the courier, "who brought dispatches from Prince Potemkin yesterday evening."

"What!" exclaimed Suwarrow, with affected passion,--"what! you bring me news from my sovereign!--you
have been here since yesterday, and I have not yet received the dispatches!" Then threatening
the officer for his negligence, he handed the dispatch to one of his generals and bade him
read it aloud.

A more striking scene can scarcely be conceived. There was deep silence as the dispatch was
opened. Suwarrow and his companions in victory listened with breathless interest. Every danger
which they had braved and surmounted was enumerated one after the other.
