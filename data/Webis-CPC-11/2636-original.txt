The second edition of a pamphlet, entitled the Voice of Humanity, has just reached us. It contains
details of the disgusting cruelties of the metropolis--as bear and badger baiting, dog-fighting,
slaughtering- horses, &c.--and reference to the abattoirs, or improved slaughter-houses for
cattle, which was illustrated in our 296th Number. In the appendix are many interesting particulars
of Smithfield Market and similar nuisances. The pamphlet is dedicated to that enlightened friend
of humanity, Sir James Mackintosh, and it appears worthy of his patronage.
