"Is it a mistake?" he said.
"Is it a secret?"

"It is not likely to be a secret if you have got hold of it," said Ingram sharply.

"I am very sorry," said the boy. "I thought you were all anxious to know--"

"It does not matter in the least," said Lavender quietly to both of them. "I shall not seek
to disturb her. I am about to leave London."

"Where are you going?" said the boy.

"I don't know yet."

That, at least, had been part of the result of his meditations; and Ingram, looking at him,
wondered whether he meant to go away without trying to say one word to Sheila.

"Look here, Lavender," he said, "you must not fancy we were trying to play any useless and
impertinent trick. To-morrow or next day Sheila will leave your aunt's house, and then I should
have told you that she had been there, and how the old lady received her. It was Sheila's own
wish that the lodgings she is going to should not be known. She fancies that would save both
of you a great deal of unnecessary and fruitless pain, do you see? That really is her only
object in wishing to have any concealment about the matter."

"But there is no need for any such concealment," he said. "You may tell Sheila that if she
likes to stay on with my aunt, so much the better; and I take it very kind of her that she
went there, instead of going home or to a strange house."

"Am I to tell her that you mean to leave London?"

"Yes."

They went into the billiard-room.
