No one can say that I know either your umbrella or my own here. I feel like I know the other one is mine. I am mistaken about both, misunderstanding their context.

We have written our text as if to think the critic was of one mind, and the criticism was towards another feeling. But the criticised filling and its critic may be earlier and later feelings from the same exact mind, it may appear that the notion of operating can be dispensed with, so that critic and criticised mean and represent the same. We believe that we have a direct view to our past feelings and know their reference. At worse, we always redirect our intentions with the feeling at present and force it to refer to the reality where our past feelings have referred.
