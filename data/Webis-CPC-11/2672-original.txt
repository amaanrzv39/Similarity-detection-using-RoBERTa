The "safeguards" proposed by the Government of Ireland Bill, 1886, were somewhat extended by
the Bill of 1893; and the proposals shortly to be submitted to Parliament, so far as they can
be gathered from recent speeches of Ministers, will not in this respect differ materially from
those contained in the latter Bill. It will therefore be convenient to take as a basis for
discussion the provisions of the Bill of 1893, as passed by the House of Commons. A Bill introduced
into the Irish Legislature was to pass both Houses; but in the event of disagreement the proposals
of the Legislative Assembly were to be submitted, after a dissolution or a delay of two years,
to a joint Session of the two Houses.
