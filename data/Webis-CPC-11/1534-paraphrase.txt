The North should stop at nothing to ensure victory.  The South has taken our property, treated our union soldiers poorly.  On top of these offenses, the South scoffs at the very core idea of the Constitution -- that a union of states has come together to ensure freedom for all -- and continues to stoke the fires of armed rebellion.  Shall we sit idly by while our Constitution is thus defamed?  Or, shall we spare no expense in either man or money to settle this struggle once and for all.
