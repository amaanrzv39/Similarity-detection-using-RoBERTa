First evaporate, on a water-bath in a well ventilated area, but finish it with a Bunsen flame, using high temperature at the end in order to decompose the double cyanides. Allow time for it to cool down. Dampen it with strong hydrochloric acid; warm it with a little water and test for metals in solution by ordinary methods. Since metals likely to be present may be given in milligrams the work must be done with care. It could be worth it to determine the lime and magnesia proportion as well as of that of metal.

Or the 20c.c of cyanide liquor may evaporate with 5c.c of strong nitric acid to dryness and gently ignited and the residue taken with 2 or 3c.c of hydrochloric acid.
