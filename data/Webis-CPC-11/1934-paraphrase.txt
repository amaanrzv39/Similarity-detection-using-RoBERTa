The bottle was opened and she sipped in honor of me with her "Wish the best for you, Master Percy. You look much older now, I should not be thinking of kissing you."

"What's wrong with kissing me? I've kissed you while sitting on your lap, and I have kissed you infront of my mother, and I will again."

"No, we can't, it is not right..only with younger boys."
