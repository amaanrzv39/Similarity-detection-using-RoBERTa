He gives
us his views on the Land Question (Shure there are Sixty-two of them, bedad!) in Water-colours,
and very bright, breezy, and delightful they are. If they will have Home Rule, if they persist
in having Ireland for the Irish, we have no desire to pick a quarrel with this accomplished
aquarelliste (Ha! ha!) for showing us the beauties of the "distrissful counthry;" and if we
are not allowed to have the real thing, we shall find the peaceful possession of Mr. RICKATSON'S
delightful pictures no mean substitute.

THE PILFERER.

TO ALL VOLAPUK-SPEAKING FOLK.

THERE exists at this moment no institution which even aspires to be to the Volapuk-speaking
world what We were whilst still We remained in Northumberland Street, and looked after things
generally. The wise are few. The governing minds are never numerous. But We have one, and We
have determined to expand it over a new Monthly Magazine. At the outset We, being, after all,
human, were confronted by the difficulty of finding a title. Several suggested themselves to
a Mind not lacking in scope. A few may be mentioned. There was the Filibuster; the Summum Bone-'em;
Macheath's Miscellany; the Monthly Marauder; the Eviscerator; the Literary Leech; the Monthly
Misappropriator; the Sixpenny Scoop. Each has its particular attraction and appropriateness.
