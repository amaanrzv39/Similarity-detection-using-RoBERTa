After remaining some time in the market-place, the governor of the town appeared, and conducted
the mission to the house of an old Moslem woman, where they were to lodge for the night. The
names of the three daughters, Major Harris observes, were worthy of the days of Prince Cherry
and Fair Star. They were Eve, Sweet Limes, and Sunbeam. The ladies vacated the house with great
good-humour; but it was low, intolerably filthy, and without bedding or food. The unfortunate
mission had thus to spend a night, probably unequaled by their sufferings in the open field.
Though so near the equator, they felt the cold severely; rain set in with great violence, pouring
through the roof, and entering into the threshold.
