Mr. Elliott said: "Gentlemen of the Convention: It is with great appreciation of the compliment
paid my State that I rise to respond to your invitation to address you. I stand here, gentlemen
of the convention, together with my colleagues from the several States, as an illustration
of an accomplished fact of American emancipation, not only as an illustration of the management
of the American people, but as a living example of the justice of the American people."

The speeches of which the foregoing are but a part of their introduction, expressive of gratitude
and fidelity, a conception of the needs of the hour, delivered with an eloquence that charmed,
elicited hearty response, the Academy echoing and re-echoing with the plaudits of the vast
assembly.
