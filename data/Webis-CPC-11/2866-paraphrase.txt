Prof. Henry stated that the sound of the whistle is spread horizontally. The sound, however, is much stronger in the plane that intersects the lower edge of the bell. With the whistle standing upright, in its normal position, the sound is most distinct in the horizontal plane passing through the whistle.

The steam fog-whistle is commonly used on steamboats and locomotives. It is between 6 to 18 inches in diameter. Steam with pressures of 50 to 100 pounds is used to operate it. The steam from the boiler is automatically shut on and off by openting and closing valves.
