These may be planted in October, and for succession
in January, the autumn-planted ones being protected by a covering of leaves or short stable
litter. They will flower in May and June, and when the leaves have ripened should be taken
up into a dry room till planting time. They are easily raised from the seed, and a bed of the
single varieties is a valuable addition to a flower-garden, as it affords, in a warm situation,
an abundance of handsome and often brilliant spring flowers, almost as early as the snowdrop
or crocus.
