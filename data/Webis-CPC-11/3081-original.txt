Willows will take care of themselves after the second or third year. The
more usual method of planting is of slips, ten inches long, set in mellow ground about eight
inches deep, in straight rows four or six feet apart, and one foot apart in the rows--except
the green willow, which is put two feet apart in the row. They should be kept clear of weeds
for the first two years. The osiers are to be cut when the bark will peel somewhat easily,
and may be put through a machine for the purpose, invented by J. Colby, of Jonesville, Vermont,
at the rate of two tons per day, removing all the bark, without injuring the wood. Different
opinions prevail respecting the varieties most profitable for cultivation; they vary in different
localities.
