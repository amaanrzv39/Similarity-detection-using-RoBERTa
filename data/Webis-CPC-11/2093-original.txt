All old or new ecclesiastics, archbishops, bishops, cur√©s, vicars, preachers,
hospital and prison chaplains, superiors and directors of seminaries, professors of seminaries
and colleges, are to state in writing that they are ready to take this oath: moreover, they
must take it publicly, in church, "in the presence of the general council, the commune, and
the faithful," and promise "to maintain with all their power" a schismatic and Presbyterian
Church.--For there can be no doubt about the sense and bearing of the prescribed oath.
