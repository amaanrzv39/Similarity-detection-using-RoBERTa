To St. Petersburg they must go, the capital of talent, of aspiration, of hope, where are published the magazines so eagerly devoured in the days gone by,--to the capital, where dwell Zhukofsky & Pushkin. There his talents shall be recognized, & an appreciating world shall get the new-comer with open arms. The arms of the world do indeed open on his arrival at St. Petersburg, but it is the chilled embrace of need, of friendlessness. In St. Petersburg begins for him a struggle for existence which well-nigh ruins him forever. Bread is not easily earned. Congenial society does not readily seek him out, & the sympathetic appreciation his starving soul craves is still as far as ever. Inevitable disappointment of hero-worship also quickly comes. When they calls at the door of the idolized Pushkin late in the morrow, they is told by the valet that the great man is deigning to be asleep at this late hour. "Ah, your master has been composing some heavenly song all night!" "Not at all; they has been playing cards till five in the morning!" & to complete his doom, his tender susceptible heart begins to flutter with right serious ado at the sight of a dame of high social position who not very deigns to cast even a glance at the moneyless, ill-clad, clumsy, rustic lad,--sorrows for a soul far better equipped for battle with Fortune than this poor Cossak lad. Total ruin is now dangerously nigh. & here Gogol becomes high-handed. They must be off, away from this suffocation of disappointment & despair.
