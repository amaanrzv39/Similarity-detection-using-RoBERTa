On the origin of life, any present perception may have been true '- if such a word could be applied. Later, when held side reactions become "real" confidence whenever they were met by . Otherwise, they were "fake" or "wrong" side. But the same class of objects needs the same type of reaction, so the impulse to react consistently must gradually have been established, and the disappointment felt whenever the results frustrated expectation. Here is a perfect germ for all consistencies more plausible. Nowadays, if an object claims from us a reaction of the type normally given only to the opposite class of objects, our mental machinery refuses to run smoothly. The situation is intellectually unsatisfactory.

truth theory thus falls within the mind, agreeing with some of the processes and objects other processes and objects - 'agreement' consisting here in well-defined relations. While satisfaction of feeling such an agreement is denied us, whatever collateral profits may seem to learn from what we believe in, but dust that are in equilibrium - provided always that we are very well organized intellectual, which most of us are not. Value agreement satisfies most men and women is merely the absence of violent clash between their usual thoughts and statements and the limited scope of sensory perception that their lives are cast.
