   Sir, I have designed a gaol for the City and county of Norwich.You have embellished  the same in your recent MIRROR, which one of your correspondents has favoured. While at Paris in 1822, I drew the mausoleum of Gospard Monge.From the drawing an engraving will be sent to you and it will be interesting to the readers.
