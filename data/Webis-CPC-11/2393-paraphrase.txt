We cannot produce pure water containing one part, by weight, of hydrogen and nine of oxygen, nor can they produce it when the ratio is one to ten; but they can produce it from the ratio of one to five, and from no other. So also when water is decomposed by the electric current, the proportion, as regards volumes, is as fixed as in the case of weights. Five volumes of hydrogen and one of oxygen invariably go the formation of water. Number and harmony, as in the Pythagorean process, are everywhere dominant in this under-world.
