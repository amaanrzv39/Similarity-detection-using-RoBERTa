Angelo fled from his palatial estate to live in a far-away, old suburban home that his wife received.  With her, he enjoyed the unassuming happiness that came with a humbled existence.  For example, he diligently schooled his sole daughter, Madame the Baroness of Hoüchters-leöen (now deceased), worked in his garden, and socialized with various erudite local men.

One day while Angelo was walking down the street, Prince Wenceslas of Lichtenstein's nephew and heir, who had been ruling for two years by this point, saw him and ordered his driver to stop the carriage.  Prince Francis took Angelo aboard and informed him that he believed in his innocence.  The heir of Prince Wenceslas would right the wrongs of his predecessor.
