However, your conduct or the results
may at times be equivalent to dishonesty, being so regarded by others. This, of course, is

"You are very keenly sensitive. With your great love of beauty and refinement, anything which
is coarse, crude, and ugly in your environment is very depressing to you. You also find it
difficult to associate happily with those who are coarse and crude by nature. Unquestionably,

to many different things, but principally to your lack of observation, your inability to see

were supplied, and you had something interesting to do, money would receive practically no

of these qualities is necessary.
