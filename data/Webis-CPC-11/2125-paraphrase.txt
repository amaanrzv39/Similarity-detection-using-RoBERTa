The other ships are made up of ships with sails less than 5 tons and rowboats.  These sailboats are, in general, not large with sloops that have a square-stern, not enclosed in the back, but with a small room in the front.  They all have centerboards, and many lapstreak with those that don't having "set work."  In the back there is standing room with a seat, the counterweight is covered over with flooring, and the cuddy has nothing but two small lofted beds and a stove to make it seem homey.  These boats generally weigh 2 tons and can be as long as 26 feet or as short as 16 and can be as wide as 9 or as narrow as 6.
