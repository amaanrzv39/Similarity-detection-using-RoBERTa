Mrs. Griffin, with her intensely energetic nature, soon effected a change. Order
took the place of disorder, under her direction; new cabins were built, neatness and system
maintained, till their good effects were so apparent, that the freedmen voluntarily pursued
the course advised by their teacher and friend; all who were able to do any work were provided
as far as possible with employment, and schools for the children in the day time, and for adults
in the evening, were established.
