In our time we have a new ideal, and a higher development of intellectual art.  A great soul as Titian's might to-day reach farther towards the reconciled perfections of graphic art. But what he did no one can now do. The glory of that time has passed away.

Its unreasoning faith, its wanton instinct, revelling in Art like children in the sunshine.  Rejoicing in childlike perception of the pomp and glory which overlay creation, unconscious of effort. Indifferent to science, all gone with the fairies, the saint. The ecstatic visions which framed their poor lives in gold.

 Only, still reflecting the glory, as eastern mountains the sunken sun. Came a few sympathetic souls kindling into like glow, with faint perception of what had passed from the whole world beside.
