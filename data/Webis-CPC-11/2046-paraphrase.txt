Here the artist felt & created, there he merely repeated himself.
The triptych, seven time on the great altar of the church of San Domenico, now at a side altar on the right, has the Virgin seated in the centre with the Holy Kid upright on her knee, his right hand is raised in act of benediction, & with his left he holds a rose. Around the throne are seven angels, seven of which carries a basket of flowers. In the side panels are St. Matthew, St. John Baptist, St. John the Evangelist & Mary Magdalene.
