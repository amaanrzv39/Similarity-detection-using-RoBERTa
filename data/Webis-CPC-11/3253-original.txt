ACKNOWLEDGING.

The ordinary form of acknowledgment (and a very graceful one it is) is accomplished as follows:--On
being hit, spring to attention, with your heels together and body erect, at the same time bringing
your sword to the recover, i.e. sword upright in front of your face, thumb in a line with your
mouth, and knuckles outwards.

The acknowledgment should be only a matter of seconds, and when made the player should come
back to the engaging guard and continue the bout.

FOUL HITS.

Of course there are occasions on which the best player cannot help dealing a foul hit. When
this happens there is nothing to be done except to apologize; but most of these hits may be
avoided by a little care and command of temper. By a foul hit is meant a blow dealt to your
opponent on receiving a blow from him--a hit given, not as an attempt to "time," but instead
of a guard and, as a matter of fact, given very often on the "blow for blow" principle.

This, of course, is great nonsense, if you assume, as you should do, that the weapons are sharp,
when such exchanges would be a little more severe than even the veriest glutton for punishment
would care for.

If you only want to see who can stand most hammering with an ash-plant, then your pads are
a mistake and a waste of time. Ten minutes without them will do more to settle that question
than an hour with them on.
