In sustaining this proposition I shall introduce no witnesses but those whose perfect reliability
is vouched for by the Atheist himself; so we shall have no dispute concerning the credibility
and perfect reliability of witnesses. For the Atheist, claiming to be a votary of reason, as
well as a boasted free and fearless thinker, certainly can not impeach the testimony of his
own mind. And, being a free and fearless thinker, he will not try to conceal or prevent the
witness, when on the stand, from telling the whole truth.
