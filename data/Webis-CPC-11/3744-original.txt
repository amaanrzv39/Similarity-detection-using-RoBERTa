Now, the law was a weariness to him, and he loathed Brenthill. Yet he had voluntarily
accepted a life which could offer him no higher prize than such a fate as this, when Godfrey
Hammond or Mrs. Middleton, or even old Hardwicke, would no doubt have helped him to something
better.

Certainly he had been a fool; and yet, while he realized this truth, he sincerely respected--I
might almost say he admired--his own folly. He had been sick of dependence, and he had gone
down at once to the bottom of everything, taken his stand on firm ground and conquered independence
for himself. He had gained the precious knowledge that he could earn his own living by the
labor of his hands. He might have been a fool to reject the help that would have opened some
higher and less distasteful career to him, yet if he had accepted it he would never have known
the extent of his own powers. He would have been a hermit-crab still, fitted with another shell
by the kindness of his friends. Had he clearly understood what he was doing when he went to
Brenthill, it was very likely that he might never have gone. He was almost glad that he had
not understood.

And now, having conquered in the race, could he go back and ask for the help which he had once
refused? Hardly. The life in which we first gain independence may be stern and ugly, the independence
itself--when we gather in our harvest--may have a rough and bitter taste, yet it will spoil
the palate for all other flavors. They will seem sickly sweet after its wholesome austerity.
