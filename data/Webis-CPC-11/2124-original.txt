I have heard both ex-President Jimenez
and ex-President Morales sorrowfully complain that their fall was due to the treachery of trusted
subordinates. A particularly repulsive case of perfidiousness was that of General Luis Felipe
Vidal, a prominent politician, who participated in the murder of President Caceres, though
he had only a few hours before visited the President, played billiards with him and fondled
his infant daughter.

Of all amusements there is none which appeals so strongly to every class of the population
as dancing.
