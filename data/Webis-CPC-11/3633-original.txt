Swine are they now called."  "Who owneth them?"  "Pryderi the
son of Pwyll; they were sent him from Annwvyn, by Arawn the king of Annwvyn, and still they
keep that name, half hog, half pig."  "Verily," asked he, "and by what means may they be obtained
from him?"  "I will go, lord, as one of twelve, in the guise of bards, to seek the swine."
"But it may be that he will refuse you," said he.  "My journey will not be evil, lord," said
he; "I will not come back without the swine." "Gladly," said he, "go thou forward."

So he and Gilvaethwy went, and ten other men with them.  And they came into Ceredigiawn, to
the place that is now called Rhuddlan Teivi, where the palace of Pryderi was.  In the guise
of bards they came in, and they were received joyfully, and Gwydion was placed beside Pryderi
that night.

"Of a truth," said Pryderi, "gladly would I have a tale from some of your men yonder."  "Lord,"
said Gwydion, "we have a custom that the first night that we come to the Court of a great man,
the chief of song recites.  Gladly will I relate a tale."  Now Gwydion was the best teller
of tales in the world, and he diverted all the Court that night with pleasant discourse and
with tales, so that he charmed every one in the Court, and it pleased Pryderi to talk with him.

And after this, "Lord," said he unto Pryderi, "were it more pleasing to thee, that another
should discharge my errand unto thee, than that I should tell thee myself what it is?"  "No,"
he answered, "ample speech hast thou."  "Behold then, lord," said he, "my errand.  It is to
crave from thee the animals that were sent thee from Annwvyn." "Verily," he replied, "that
were the easiest thing in the world to grant, were there not a covenant between me and my land
concerning them.
