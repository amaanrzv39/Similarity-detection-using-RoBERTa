AN UNINVITED GUEST

In the lull following Mr. O'Brien's story the conductor and porter went hurriedly through the
car out to the rear platform; where, it seems, they had been summoned by the brakeman. They
quickly reappeared with as bedraggled and woebegone a specimen of humanity as it has ever been
my misfortune to see. An unwashed, evil-smelling, half-frozen Hobo was dragged into the car,
to our utter amazement!

"Hold on a minute, conductor," said Colonel Manysnifters, as they were rushing the captive
through. "What have you here? Where did you get him? Who are you, sir?" asked he of the tramp.
"Who are you, I say, and what are you doing on this strictly private outfit?"
