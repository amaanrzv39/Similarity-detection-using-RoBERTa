A few miles upriver from Jamestown, at Falling Creek, the English built their first iron furnace
in America in 1620-21. Iron was smelted in the furnace, and a few tools were forged--the first
iron objects made in the New World by the English. In 1622 the Indians massacred the ironworkers
and their families, and destroyed the furnace. Although it was never rebuilt, its importance
cannot be overstressed, for the Falling Creek site can rightfully claim the honor of being
the birthplace of the American iron industry.
