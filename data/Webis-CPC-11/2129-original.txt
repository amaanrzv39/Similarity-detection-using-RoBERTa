heavily and in gusts and through it he looked about at the small cabins standing dreary in
their dismantled fields. Marie Louiseâ€™s was the nearest at hand and towards it he directed

to him before he had time to knock, and entering he saw Fanny seated before the fire holding
a pair of very wet smoking feet to dry. His first sensation was one of relief at finding her
safe and housed.
