With the time and scene, the incident was interesting and wild with just enough of the awful to give and additional piquancy. The night was dark and stormy and the wind roared among the trees: the torches cast a red and flickering light on the rocks in out immediate neighbourhood and just showed us enough of the depths of the forest to make the back ground nore unfathomable. 

The distant halloos of the men who were gone in search of their breeze, and the occassional shots that we fired rang through the rocky jungle with an almost interminable echo. In about 45 minutes our bearers joined us with the two patarra bearers.
