In
every department of the exposition the great resources of Illinois were shown.

The State House was, with possibly two exceptions, the most pretentious of all the State buildings,
and certainly its location was the most commanding. From the intramural cars this great white
structure, with its generous verandas and its wealth of ornament, could be seen at several
points. It was not on the Plateau of States, but was the important member of another State
group on The Trail, directly west of the Cascade Gardens. Across the way were the beautiful
gardens of Japan, and the Lincoln Museum was directly north.

The building was designed along the lines of the French renaissance, but it was entirely modern
in treatment.
