"Dog." The only question is whether the offspring of this cross is a
mule, and, like other mules, incapable of continuing its race; or whether it is prolific? The
latter position is maintained by Mr. Bell, in his History of British Quadrupeds. "The dog and
wolf will readily breed together (he says), and their progeny is fertile." But query, can any
authentic instance be produced of a cross between a dog and a wolf, which has produced a prolific
animal?
