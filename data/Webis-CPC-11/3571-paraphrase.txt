When theorizers want to visualize the types of beings earthlings could run in to when visiting other worlds in our solar system, they often use math to figure gravitational forces and utilize scientific data to come up with the size, strength, and form of such creatures. This is all dine, but the very first bit of data they should consider is the length of the year of the planet in question and the workings of the seasons there. For example, Mars and Venus rotate on schedules that are not very different from Earth; therefore, life on these two might be theorized as similar to that on Earth. If this rotation was vastly different, than the life on that planet could also be expected to be dissimilar. 

Two important facts cannot be ignored. First, the way we conceive of time depends on the Nature of the Law of Periodicity. Second, periodicities which determine the types of animal and plant life on our planet are the periodic movements of the planet. Thus, these should be applied to other planets as well.
