We assure them that we have worked upon a regular
plan, and where we have failed of executing our design, it has not been for want of labour
or attention. Convinced that it is the duty and the interest of all who write, to inquire what
others have said and thought upon the subject of which they treat, we have examined attentively
the works of others, that we might collect whatever knowledge they contain, and that we might
neither arrogate inventions which do not belong to us, nor weary the public by repetition.
