In sum, so many are the grounds of her grace and the just causes of her commendation, that,
leaving her worth to the description of better wits, I will in these few words conclude my
conceit of her:--She is the stoutness of the heart and the strength of the mind, a gift of
God and the glory of the world.

HONOUR.

Honour is a title or grace given by the spirit of virtue to the desert of valour in the defence
of truth; it is wronged in baseness and abused in unworthiness, and endangered in wantonness
and lost in wickedness. It nourisheth art and crowneth wit, graceth learning and glorifieth
wisdom; in the heraldry of heaven it hath the richest coat, being in nature allied unto all
the houses of grace, which in the heaven of heavens attend the King of kings. Her escutcheon
is a heart, in which in the shield of faith she bears on the anchor of hope the helmet of salvation:
she quarters with wisdom in the resolution of valour, and in the line of charity she is the
house of justice. Her supporters are time and patience, her mantle truth, and her crest Christ
treading upon the globe of the world, her impress Corona mea Christus. In brief, finding her
state so high that I am not able to climb unto the praise of her perfection, I will leave her
royalty to the register of most princely spirits, and in my humble heart thus only deliver
my opinion of her:--She is virtue's due and grace's gift, valour's wealth and reason's joy.

TRUTH.

Truth is the glory of time and the daughter of eternity, a title of the highest grace, and
a note of a divine nature. She is the life of religion, the light of love, the grace of wit,
and the crown of wisdom: she is the beauty of valour, the brightness of honour, the blessing
of reason, and the joy of faith.
