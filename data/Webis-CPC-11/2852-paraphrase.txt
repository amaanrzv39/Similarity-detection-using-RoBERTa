My plan was to shoot three of them and hang them like thieves to scare the others that came to the corn; and from then on, as long as they hung, no bird came. When the corn ripened, I made a scythe out of the swords of the ship, and got in my crop.

Very few would think about the cost at which bread was produced. When I got the corn home, I had to crush it, part of the grain from the chaff and store it. Then came the need to grind it with a mill, chain it with sleeves, and to make bread with yeast.

My bread was made anyway without tools. No one can deny that I earned it by my own sweat. 

The next thing to make was a sieve to take the grain apart from the husks.
