Americans spend thier time contemplating thier plight, yet compared to the rest of the world they have it pretty good. In American all one needs is a lil hard work to make it to the top. In England things are different. There is less oppurtunity for honest working men in Britain than in the US. If British citizens want to make money they need to model themselves after the Brazilians.
