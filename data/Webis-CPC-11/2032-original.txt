In form they
all resembled the upper one with its steep ledges, and had evidently been formed in the same
way--by the action of the sea, and more especially of the ice. Like the upper one, they also
were most marked on the west and north sides of the island, which are those facing most to
the open sea.

To the student of the history of the earth these marks of the former level of the sea are of
great interest, showing as they do that the land has risen or the sea sunk since the time they
were formed.
