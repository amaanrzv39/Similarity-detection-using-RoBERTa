We were fourteen fathoms above the starboard. The little sail could not withstand and collapsed into the water.

One of the five flukes were also broken, since it was so knotted when they tried to get the first anchor which was sent out in a boat and then another, they took a long time over it.  During this time we were kept away from the reef by poles. The broken anchor was later brought to the shore and we were very grateful to be safe. 

Madrepore is the only thing which enveloped the flat ground for miles inland, and covered with semi fossilized sea-shells. The inlands looked as though no human or any life existed for thousands of years. Before we reached the first spurs of the mountains, we had to walk over for three miles and we had never seen or could imagine such a barren or arid spot.
