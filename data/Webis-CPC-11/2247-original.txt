Among some tribes freedom is permitted to the women before marriage. Heriot states that the
natives who allow this justify the custom, and say “that a young woman is mistress of her own
person, and a free agent.”[61] The tie of marriage is, however, observed more strictly than
among many civilised monogamous races. And this is so, although divorce is always easy and
by mutual consent; a couple being able to separate at once if they are dissatisfied with each
other.
