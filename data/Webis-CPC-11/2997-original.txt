The first cu. sett and cast off."

As we love to keep up the dance, if we are not leading the reader a dance, we give A Dance
in Hoops, as described in a fashionable novel, just published:--

When the whole party was put in motion, but little trace of a regular dance remained; all was
a perfect maze, and the cutting in and out (as the fraternity of the whip would phrase it)
of these cumbrous machines presented to the mind only the figure of a most formidable affray.

The nearest assimilation to this strange exhibition of the dance in full career, at all familiar
to our minds, is the prancing of the basket-horses in Mr. Peake's humorous farce of Quadrupeds.

An entertaining variety of appearance arose also from the conformity of the steps to the diversified
measure of the tune.
