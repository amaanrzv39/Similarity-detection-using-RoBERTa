From 2 till 4 is the traditional time of exercise, the most usual modes of which are walking and rowing. Cricketing, and all games of ball, are much practised in their respective seasons. Towards 4 P.M., they begin to flock in for dinner. 

A Latin grace is read by two of the dons, and forthwith the demolition of eatables proceeds. Though there is a common hall, there is no common table. 

Two scholars conclude the business by reading a long Latin grace--the dons, it is said, being too full after dinner for such duty. After hall is emphatically lounging-time. On the contrary, there is no end to the variety, both as respects rank, provision, and privilege. Hall lasts about three-quarters of an hour.
