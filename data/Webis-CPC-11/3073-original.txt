I cannot be said here either to know your umbrella, or my own, which latter my
feeling more completely resembles. I am mistaking them both, misrepresenting their context, etc.

We have spoken in the text as if the critic were necessarily one mind, and the feeling criticised
another. But the criticised feeling and its critic may be earlier and later feelings of the
same mind, and here it might seem that we could dispense with the notion of operating, to prove
that critic and criticised are referring to and meaning to represent the SAME. We think we
see our past feelings directly, and know what they refer to without appeal. At the worst, we
can always fix the intention of our present feeling and MAKE it refer to the same reality to
which any one of our past feelings may have referred.
