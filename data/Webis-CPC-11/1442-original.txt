His mother had never been very strong, and had had a good deal of anxiety; at
last she was taken ill, and soon felt that there was no hope for her recovery. For a long time
the thought of leaving her little boy was a great distress to her, and a great trial to her
faith. But God strengthened her, and sent his peace into her soul, and before her death she
was content to leave her precious child in his hands, who is a Father to the fatherless, and
defendeth the cause of the widow.
