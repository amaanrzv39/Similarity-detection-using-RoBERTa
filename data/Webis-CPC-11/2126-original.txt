How much this may enter as a partial factor into

an indication of preputial local irritation. "If practicable, circumcision should be performed;
it is an operation with but small risk or danger, and easy of performance. In such circumstances
it is always permissible to circumcise, were it for no other end than an acknowledged attempt
to reach a cure."
