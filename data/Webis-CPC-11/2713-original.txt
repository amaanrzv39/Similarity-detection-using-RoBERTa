Shall we, then, let the students of posterity remain in the dark
on such questions as these: why Providence became the second city of New England; why she left
Newport so badly in the race for prosperity; why Buffalo and Cincinnati went up, while Black
Rock and North Bend went down; why Chicago became the largest manufacturing city on the continent;
why New England kept the town-meeting, and the West preferred the township and the county;
and why a thousand and one other important things happened. To be sure we have had Bancroft,
and Sparks, and Hildreth, but these and their brethren have told us as little about the history
of the people as Lingard, Hume, Hallam, and all the rest of them told England.
