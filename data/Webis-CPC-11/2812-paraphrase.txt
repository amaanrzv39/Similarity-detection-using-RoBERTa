John Gird was in possession of a note endorsed for $4,100 by one Isaac Entwistle, in the autumn of 1819. He morgaged some of his possessions, a list of which follows:
"one clock, one sideboard, two mahogany dining tables, two tea ditto, one pair card tables, one secretary, two bureaus, one writing desk, one dozen rush bottom chairs, one ditto with settee to match, one sofa, two looking glasses, carpets, brass andirons, two fenders, shovel, tongs, window curtains, three bedsteads and beds, chair, wash stand, chest, house linen, one set gilt tea china, four waiters, one half dozen silver teaspoons, one set plated castors, sundry glass and earthen ware, kitchen furniture, etc."[121] 

This debt was left unpaid for six years, until John Gird secured it with his house and lot.
