In
the Gardeners' Chronicle for September 25, of that year, page 398, it is said that the boxwood
forests of Mingrelia in the Caucasian range were almost exhausted. Old forests, long abandoned,
were even then explored in search of trees that might have escaped the notice of former proprietors,
and wood that was rejected by them was, in 1875, eagerly purchased at high prices for England.
The export of wood was at that time prohibited from Abhasia and all the government forests
in the Caucasus.
