Though Dr.Edward Tyson, F.R.S. wrote many books, he is not an author of a work on mental illness.  His painted picture kept in the College.  He died at the age of 58 in 1708 and his grave is in Dionys Backchurch with a beautiful memorial.  He is the author of Garth's Dispensary.
The flow of slothful small muddy pool is felt in his Chill veins.  It exposes his mental confusion and mourning garments.  He is intimate with the military force of mentally unsounded persons.  In fact his large territorial division released on compensation.
His attractive relation with Bethlem is descending by inheritance.  No doubt, that on record of order of history Dr. James Monro was remarkable phisician to Bethlem in 1728.  Finally he left the world on 1752.  According to his son, he was a respectful and recognised personality who look into the mentally unsoundness as nothing but attain the status of normal personality soon.
