He was born 21/07/1664, by some, from Wimborne, in Dorsetshire, for they know not what parents, others say he was the son of a joiner in London: he was probably quite willing to leave his birth unsettled in hope, as Don Quixote, the history of his actions might find some illustrious alliance. He entered his name in St. John's College, Cambridge, in 1682, in its eighteenth year, and it is assumed that he was distinguished among his contemporaries. He became a Bachelor, as usual, in four years, and two years after he wrote his poem to god, who was in his first volume.

College is established practice that each year to send the Earl of Exeter some poems on sacred subjects, in recognition of a blessing to those enjoyed by its ancestor prize. On this occasion the verses were written, which, although nothing is said about their success, seem to recommend him some notice, to praise the music of the countess, and its lines of Seneca's famous picture, allowing reason to imagine that he was more or less conversant with that family.

The same year he published "The City Mouse and Country Mouse" to ridicule Dryden's "Hind and Panther" in conjunction with Mr. Montague. There is a story of suffering great pain, and shed tears on that occasion by Dryden, who thought hard that it "an old man should BE so treated by those who had always been civil."
