Paper so prepared turns
immediately blue when exposed to the action of ozone, the tint being lighter or darker according
to the quantity. Schoenbein's ozonometer consists of 750 slips of dry bibulous paper prepared
in the manner described; and with a scale of tints and instructions, sufficient to make observations
on the ozone of the atmosphere twice a day for a year. After exposure to the ozone, they require
to be moistened to bring out the colour.
