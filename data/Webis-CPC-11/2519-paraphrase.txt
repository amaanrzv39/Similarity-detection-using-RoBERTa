It was in the early summer of 1917 at the time.  In Congress a declaration had been made the preceding April that Germany had been waging war on the United States; the President had passed and signed war resolutions.  All this happened on April 6.  The Navy Department had put into effect plans on April 7 that had been formulated already.  When the President boarded the flag-ship of the Atlantic Fleet that early summer afternoon much had been done.  Already at work were sojme of our destroyers in foreign waters, but already preparing for conflict at home was the bulk of our fighting force.  Trying to protect our shores against the evil devices of the enemy it was at this time the President chose to meet those upon whom the nation relied to check the submarine.
