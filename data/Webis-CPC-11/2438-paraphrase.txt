I never heard of your Colonel Smith--I'm not drawing up real estate lots or plots of any kind. Thirdly, I solemnly swear by Minos, Alianthus, Rhododendron, Nebuchadnezzar, & all the infernal gods, that if you touch a hair of our heads I'll see Colonel Smith--I'll map the whole property & promote it in every newspaper in New-York & Boston till it brings ten thousand dollars an acre. Now sail in--dog or no dog--we'll settle you, any how.'
The glare of fury in our visitor's eyes died away as they listened to this oration.
