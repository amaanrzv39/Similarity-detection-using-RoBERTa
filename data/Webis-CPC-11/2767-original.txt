That was one of my finest
conceptions";[6177] M. de Fontanes and the other university men did not comprehend this or
want to comprehend it. Napoleon himself could give only a moment of attention to his school
work, his halting-spells between two campaigns;[6178] in his absence, "they spoiled for him
his best ideas"; "his executants "never perfectly carried out his intentions. "He scolded,
and they bowed to the storm, but not the less continued on in the usual way." Fourcroy kept
too much of the Revolution in mind, and Fontanes too much of the ancient r√©gime; the former
was too much a man of science, and the latter too much a man of letters; with such capacities
they laid too great stress on intellectual culture and too little on discipline of the feelings.
