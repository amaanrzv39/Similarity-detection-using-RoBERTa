The temperature is kept at about 165 deg., and so rapid is the drying process that in the short
space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready
for shipment.

After leaving the dry rooms it is assorted, counted, and put up in packages of one hundred
each, and tied with cords like lath, when it is ready for shipment. Bird's-eye maple veneer
is much more valuable and requires more care than almost any other, and this is packed in cases
instead of tied in bundles.
