A REPLY TO DR. LIGHTFOOT'S FIRST ESSAY ON "SUPERNATURAL RELIGION." [Endnote 1:1]

The function of the critic, when rightly exercised, is so important, that it is fitting that
a reviewer seriously examining serious work should receive serious and respectful consideration,
however severe his remarks and however unpleasant his strictures. It is scarcely possible that
a man can so fully separate himself from his work as to judge fairly either of its effect as
a whole or its treatment in detail; and in every undertaking of any magnitude it is almost
certain that flaws and mistakes must occur, which can best be detected by those whose perception
has not been dulled by continuous and over-strained application. No honest writer, however
much he may wince, can feel otherwise than thankful to anyone who points out errors or mistakes
which can be rectified; and, for myself, I may say that I desire nothing more than such frankness,
and the fair refutation of any arguments which may be fallacious.

Reluctant as I must ever be, therefore, to depart from the attitude of silent attention which
I think should be maintained by writers in the face of criticism, or to interrupt the fair
reply of an opponent, the case is somewhat different when criticism assumes the vicious tone
of the Rev. Dr. Lightfoot's article upon Supernatural Religion in the December number of the
"Contemporary Review."
