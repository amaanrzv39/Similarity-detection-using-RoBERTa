Despite the startling nature of the sound I had just heard, I continue towards my home. The mixture of emotions had left me uncertain of what to do, and I felt as if I had just been attacked by a wild beast. Regardless, I reasoned that continuing home would be my safest option. How your imagine works when you've been startled!
