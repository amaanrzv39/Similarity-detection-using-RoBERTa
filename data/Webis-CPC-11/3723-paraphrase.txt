These two facts told me via Mr. J. R. Kincaid of Blue Ridge.

MAHALA JEWEL =Ex-Slave--Age 76.=

Mahala Jewel, known within the settlement as "Aunt Hailie," was sitting onto her small porch when the interviewer arrived. "I'se a-tryin' towards git my foots warm," she declared. "Dey was cold everybody last night, and didn't warm up nobody even when I had done sauntered everybody de distance up towards de courthouse towards git dem cabbage what de interests ladies had for me today. Yes Ma'am, beaten sho' is steely moments wid old Hailie now. I was elevated whar folks had plenty. Our white folks warn't none pore white trash, and whether my old Marster and Mist'ess was a-livin' today dey sho' would do somepin' for old Hailie within a hurry, 'cause dey allus grant ourselves plenty of evvything dey had."

Aunt Hailie's rickety chair was kept within vigorous movement as she talked and the visitor was fearful it would fold at any moment. One rocker was smashed and onto top of the cushions within the low seat of the chair she was sitting onto an old cheese box. Suddenly she emerged towards go within the house towards "see whether dem cabbages is a-burnin'," and when she replaced she cautiously tweaked the container ahead of resuming her precarious perch within the old rocking chair. When she was sure that her feet were within a sunny dot, she began her narrative.
"Gracie Wright was my Ma's name 'fore she tuk off and wed my Pa. He was named Tuggle, and both of 'em belonged towards Marse Hamp McWhorter onto his plantation down within Oglethorpe County. Marse Hamp was sho' a rich man and onto his big old plantation dey elevated evvything dey necessary lak, peas, 'tatoes, ingons, collards, cabbages, and turnip sallet, beans, punkins, and plenty of corn, wheat and rye. Marse Hamp had lots of cows, hogs, sheep, and goats too. Miss Liza was our Mist'ess, and she elevated many chickens dan dey ever could use.
