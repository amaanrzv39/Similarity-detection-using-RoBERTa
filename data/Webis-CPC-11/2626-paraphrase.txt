It might not surprise anyone, if I added length to my chain by a link or two, and in an age of relaxed discipline, indulged my notions. If that was permissable, maybe I could (unintentionally and without unforgivable trespasses)trust my own cautious and hard working, though rather dull investigations to their insightful, sharp eyed authority. But the freedom of today is highly valuable. It shouldn't be corrupted by abuse. Only a chosen few, who at birth inherit it as a representation of democracy are worthy of it and can claim ownership. They leave nothing at all, to the outcasts of the plebian race.
