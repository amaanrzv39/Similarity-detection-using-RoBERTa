Other coarse fish are as a rule easy to introduce into a
water. Though perch fry form excellent food for trout, perch, and of course pike, should be
kept out of a trout water.

The suitability of a water depends to a great extent (as to its capacity of supporting a healthy
stock of fish) upon its having plenty of suitable vegetation upon the banks. Therefore if the
banks are bare of vegetation, willows and alders, as being quick growing and easily established
trees, should be freely planted upon the banks.
