For instance, a tenant in tail male made a lease for years with covenants of right to let and
for quiet enjoyment, and then died without issue male. The lessee assigned the lease to the
plaintiff. The latter was soon turned out, and thereupon brought an action upon the covenant
against the executor of the lessor. It was held that he could not recover, because he was not
privy in estate with the original covenantee. For the lease, which was the original covenantee's
estate, was ended by the death of the lessor and termination of the estate tail out of which
the lease was granted, before the form of assignment to the plaintiff. /1/

The only point remaining to make the analogy between covenants for title and warranty complete
was to require assigns to be mentioned in order to enable them to sue.
