The Mendelssohnian rule of "getting over the ground" (des flotten Daruberhinweggehens) suggested a happy expedient; conductors gladly adopted the maxim, and turned it into a veritable dogma; so that, nowadays, attempts to perform classical music correctly are openly denounced as heretical!

  Thus,where are the modifications of expression to come from if the very means of expression are defective?

  I am persistently returning to the question of   tempo. It is the point at which it becomes evident whether a conductor understands his business or not. (Figuration). The conductor should lead accordingly.

The Adagio stands to the Allegro as the sustained tone stands to the RHYTHMICAL MOVEMENT (figurirte Bewegung).
