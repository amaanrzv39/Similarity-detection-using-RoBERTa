When they started they were stranger;but now they were chatting pleasantly at the near end of their journey.The little Old Lady was from country and was neat and simple in her appearance; She was neat and trimmed which was rarely seen in the people from city. She carried big bunch of hedgerow flowers. She was little nervous about travelling and more nervous  about the noise and confusion in the great city. She inquired about the sight she would see on reaching the city from Stockbroker and Curate and what she should pay to the cab man,and which were the best shops.
