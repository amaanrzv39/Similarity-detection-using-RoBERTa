Where Marlborough left the thread of events, he takes up from there; only at the peace of Utrecht he makes a start. Even if he had set off at the Revolution, the case would have mostly been the same, since he is not by nature a military historian.  Lord Mahon’s powers have been put forth, since he concentrated on domestic story that is on the illustrations of parliamentary contests or court intrigues and not on military events.  A lucid, judicious, and well-designed narrative of the British history has been given by him, with these, as well as he could by his accomplished writing. The historian of Marlborough nevertheless must not treat him as second to anyone including Louis XIV or William III. His Life should be included in every schoolboy’s subjects as a separate work; otherwise we cannot say that justice has been done to the hero of the English revolution.
