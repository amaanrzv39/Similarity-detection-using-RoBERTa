Deities with broken or crippled legs are rebellious and supposedly universally fell from heaven.  This is the same theory of the devil's broken leg during his fall. (luke 10:18).  There are others who have broken legs as well such as Vulcan, Loki, Hephaestos, and Wieland.  Some say the idea was derived from lightning flashes as they are crooked.  In a midiaeval German play, the devil's mother walks on crutches.  Lame feet also plagued Asmodeus, the Persian demon in Le Sage's book Le Diable boiteax.  Asmodeus seems to be limping and walks with sticks for crutches.  The rabbinical tradition tells us that the demon Asmodeus broke his leg while hurrying to meet King Solomon.
