There is a tradition that John Tradescant the younger entered himself
on board a privateer going against the Algerines, that he might have an opportunity of bringing
apricot-trees from that country. He is known to have taken a voyage to Virginia, whence he
returned with many new plants. The two Tradescants were the means of introducing a variety
of curious species into this kingdom, several of which bore their name. Tradescants' Spiderwort
and Aster are well known to this day, and Linn√¶us has immortalised them among the botanists
by making a new genus under their names of the Spiderwort, which had been before called Ephemeron.

When the elder Tradescant first settled in England, he formed a curious collection of natural
history, coins, medals, and a great variety of "uncommon rarities." A catalogue of them was
published in 12mo. in the year 1656, by his son, under the name of Museum Tradescantianum;
to which are prefixed portraits, both of the father and son, by Hollar. This Museum or "Ark,"
as it was termed, was frequently visited by persons of rank, who became benefactors thereto;
among these were Charles the First, Henrietta Maria (his queen), Archbishop Laud, George Duke
of Buckingham, Robert and William Cecil, Earls of Salisbury, and many other persons of distinction:
among them also appears the philosophic John Evelyn, who in his Diary has the following notice:

    "Sept. 17, 1657, I went to see Sir Robert Needham, at Lambeth, a
    relation of mine, and thence to John Tradescant's museum."
