Mr. Moody MacTear, are you aware that brass instrument players are habitually sweated in orchestras and bands?

--It depends on what you mean. I certainly admit that their activities often conduce to profuse perspiration.

Mr. Moody MacTear: Have you ever played the trombone yourself?

--No, nor the lyre either.

Mr. Gladney Jebb, are you prepared to deny that the strain on the nerves of players in Jazz-bands, especially drums, is greater than that endured by soldiers in the front-line trenches during an intense bombardment?

--As a rule I am prepared to deny at sight any statement for which you are responsible, but I concede you the big drum.

Sir Leonardo Spaghetti Coyne.
