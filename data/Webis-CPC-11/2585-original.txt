A lazy man was planting corn in the high land. He would plant a few seeds and then put his
planting stick in the ground and lean back on it. After a while the stick grew there and was

A very lazy boy got a piece of sugar-cane and went home with it. When he got home, he told
his mother to take off the outside of the stalk so he might eat it. His mother was angry to
see him so lazy and told him that if he could not take it off himself, to stick it up his anus.
He did so and became a monkey.
