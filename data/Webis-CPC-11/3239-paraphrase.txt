It is much better than our primitive emotions, with its vast store of potential energy, must be won by the spiritual interests in the only terms they understand, that should be left to themselves objects of low spending.

If, therefore, the spiritual or life regeneration is unlikely to prosper without incorporation into the institutions, some definite link with the past, it also seems likely to need to operate full of propaganda and symbols and liturgy of a cult. Once again, the right path is that of compliance, not destruction, further investigation of the meaning of worship, which retains the values and needs to be met, a clearer understanding and more humble in our human limitations. We must also clearly understand that those responsible for the future, as the Church has its special dangers of conservatism, warmth, intolerance, a running count of the initiative, the internal tendency to shut themselves and escape reality, so the worship has its special dangers of which are perhaps the main formalism, magic, and spiritual sloth. Receipt and storage as it does all the successive deposits of racial experience, it is the home of magic: archaic tendency to attribute the words and deeds, the special power to a priestly caste, and to make himself essential mediator between the creative spirit and the soul. Furthermore, using always makes and symbols of the most archaic must directly appeal to the latent primitive in each of us, offers a constant temptation to fall back on something below our best effort.
