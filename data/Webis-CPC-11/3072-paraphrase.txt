we have spoken in this writing, as the the person critising was one person, and the one being critisised was another. But in reality they may both be earlier andlater feelings from the same mind. We think we can feel out past feelings as strong as when they were felt. At the worst, we can fix the intentions of our presnt feelings, and make it refer to the same time that one of our past feelings occurred.
