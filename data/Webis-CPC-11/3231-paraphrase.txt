The town we first went to see, which was well worth our time to visit, as near as I could guess was located in the heart of this land.  It was constructed of straight streets which ran in cross lines.
The men I saw in these parts of the world were only herd or belonged to crowd of mean slaves.  So it was difficult for me to believe when my friends say such fine things as the wealthy state and flourishing trade in these parts, when I returned to my birthplace. To France and Spain or to the land of ours, what is their trade? How can their ports, with a few junks and barks stand our grand fleets? Their ports look so weak that they would not stand for one month such an attack as we could bring to bear on them with just one of our large ship of war bringing all their ships down, or one line of French troops that would beat all their horses.
