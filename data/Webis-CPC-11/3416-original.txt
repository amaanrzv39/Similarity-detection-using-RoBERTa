A good old saying puts the matter very plainly:
"One boy's a boy, two boys are half a boy, and three boys are no boy at all!"

It is, in fact, ridiculous for townspeople, lawyers, and manufacturers to legislate for the
labour of the farm; they do not understand that indoor labour in the workshop or factory, under
regular conditions and with unvarying materials, is totally different from labour out of doors,
in constantly changing conditions of season, weather, and the resulting crops dealt with. An
old maxim of the Worcestershire labourer who, without a fixed place, took on piece-work at
specially busy times, will confirm this: "Go to a good farmer for wheat-hoeing, and to a bad
one for harvesting." I may explain that the fields of the good farmer are clean and nearly
free from weeds, so that hoeing is a comparatively light job; but the same, or nearly the same,
price per acre is paid by the bad farmer, whose corn is overrun with weeds, entailing much
more time and harder work. On the other hand, the good farmer's wheat crop is much heavier
than that of the bad, and, the prices for cutting being again very similar, more money per
diem can be earned at harvest on the farm of the latter.

It is a sound old Worcestershire saying that "the time to hoe is when there are no weeds"--apparently
a paradox, but the meaning is simple: when no weeds are to be seen above ground there are always
millions of tiny seedlings just below the surface ready to increase and multiply wonderfully
with a shower of rain; if attacked at the seedling stage, these can be slaughtered in battalions,
with far greater ease and efficacy than when they become deep-rooted and established, and dominate
the crop.
