They were built by English shipwrights and carpenters,
who came from a long line of efficient craftsmen. These small vessels afforded the principal
means of transportation through the uncharted wilderness tidewaters of Virginia. They were
used for fishing, trade, and discovery. A few small handwrought iron tools used by Jamestown
boatbuilders have been excavated on the historic island.

THE POTTER

In 1955 a pottery kiln site was discovered at Jamestown. Nearby were found many utilitarian
earthenware vessels of the 1625-40 period--definite evidence that pottery was made in Virginia
over 300 years ago. Although made for everyday use, many of the pieces unearthed are symmetrical
and not entirely lacking in beauty.
