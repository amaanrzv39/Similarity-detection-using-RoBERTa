(2)Another dispute for the belief in common descent is the appearance of degenerate organs in the higher animals. There are more than one hundred fundemental organs in man, for example, such as the pineal gland and vermiform appendix, and so on. Several of these vestigal organs, are without function in man, as they do function in lower animals, and this goes to prove that sometime in the past they also functioned in man.

(3) Embryology facts seem to determine the descent of higher animals from that of the lower animals. During the developmental stage of the fetus the species previous stages seem to be repeated.
