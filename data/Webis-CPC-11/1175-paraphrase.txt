One of the first flowers to bloom in spring, the pink and white blossoms of Trailing Arbutus, linger in my memory for their simple beauty.  As a child I recall that it grew near to the stream that ran by my father's cottage door.  I would build tiny water wheels and play with them in the sparkling cold water as the breeze gently ruffled the Arbutus blossoms and the sweet scent filled my nostrils.  I can't smell that fragrance today without being transported in my mind to those happy days.
