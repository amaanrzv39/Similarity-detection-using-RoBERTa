As
a magistrate he had made, on his own responsibility and against all the power of the Glenallan
family, the legal inquiries into the death of the Earl's young wife. Indeed, during a residence
which she had made at Knockwinnock Castle with the Wardour family twenty years ago, and while
she was still only known as Miss Eveline Neville, the Antiquary had loved her and had asked
her to be his wife. It was, indeed, chiefly on her account that he had never married. Mr. Oldbuck
had never ceased to mourn her, and now, believing as he had good reason to do, that the Earl
was the cause of her untimely death, and of the stigma which rested upon her name, it was little
wonder that he should wish to have no dealings with him.

But the Earl had a great need in his heart to speak to some one. In a moment the whole world
seemed to have changed for him. For the first time he knew the truth about a dark deed of cruelty.
For the first time, also, he knew that he had a son. He desired above all else the wise counsel
of a true friend. In his heart he had admired the fearlessness of the Antiquary in the bold
inquiry he had made at the time of Eveline Neville's death, and now, refusing to be rebuffed,
he followed Mr. Oldbuck as he was turning away, and demanded that he should not deny him his
counsel and assistance at a most terrible and critical moment.

It was not in the good Antiquary's nature to refuse such a request from Earl or beggar, and
their interview ended in the Earl's accepting the hospitality of Monkbarns for the night, in
order that they might have plenty of time to discuss the whole subject of Elspeth's communication.

On his own part Mr. Oldbuck had some comfort to give Lord Glenallan.
