He was born July 21, 1664, according to some, at Wimborne, in Dorsetshire, of I know not what
parents; others say that he was the son of a joiner of London:  he was perhaps willing enough
to leave his birth unsettled, in hope, like Don Quixote, that the historian of his actions
might find him some illustrious alliance.  He entered his name in St. John's College, at Cambridge,
in 1682, in his eighteenth year; and it may be reasonably supposed that he was distinguished
among his contemporaries.  He became a Bachelor, as is usual, in four years, and two years
afterwards wrote the poem on the Deity, which stands first in his volume.

It is the established practice of that College to send every year to the Earl of Exeter some
poems upon sacred subjects, in acknowledgment of a benefaction enjoyed by them from the bounty
of his ancestor.  On this occasion were those verses written, which, though nothing is said
of their success, seem to have recommended him to some notice; for his praise of the countess's
music, and his lines on the famous picture of Seneca, afford reason for imagining that he was
more or less conversant with that family.

The same year he published "The City Mouse and Country Mouse," to ridicule Dryden's "Hind and
Panther," in conjunction with Mr. Montague.  There is a story of great pain suffered, and of
tears shed, on this occasion by Dryden, who thought it hard that "an old man should be so treated
by those to whom he had always been civil."
