In rank to facilitate the fabricate of like tissues on the power loom the congratulated Swiss fabricator, Hanneger, has devised an apparatus in which the shuttle is not flung, but passed from one boundary to the other by employing lures, by a method analogous to weaving fine clothing by hand. A loom assembled on this belief was shown at work weaving fine clothing at the Paris Exhibition of 1878. This apparatus, exemplified in the annexed diagram, encompasses some arrangements which are new and interesting. On each boundary of the woof in the heddle there is a carrier, B. These carriers are gave with lures, A A', having appendages, a a', which are fitted in the shuttle, O. The second referred is of peculiar construction.
