The Hotel des Messageries is pleasant, and here, as in the more primitive regions before described, you are received as a guest to be made much of than as a foreigner to be imposed on. This charming bonhomie, found among all classes, is apt to take the form of gossip overmuch, which is sometimes wearisome. The Franc-Comtois, I must believe, are the greatest talkers in the world, and any chance listener to be caught by the button is not easily let go.
