Haddo, the clergyman pulled a bottle of spirits out of the pocket of his long woollen plaid wrap, and offered it to Janet. The two of them sat down on a soft hill of heather and traded the bottle back and forth, taking long sips. There was a boy, Francie, hiding nearby, and, if he had known anything about mythology, he may have mistaken the cleric for the God Pan, and the young woman, who was joking and laughing beside him, for a lovely woodland fairy. Though Janet had more the build of a burlesque dancer, than a wood nymph.
It seemed to the boy remarked that the two of them were great pals. 
When Haddo finally got up to depart, the young lady threw pebbles at him, while shrieking merrily. The man frolicked around and waggled his walking stick at her, and let out a guffaw that drowned out the girl's giggling.  
They seemed to be having a little too much fun, the boy thought, and when he felt it was safe to come out, sat down and pondered what he had witnessed.
