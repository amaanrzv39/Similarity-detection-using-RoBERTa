Since you love the word 'true' so, and since you despise so the
concrete working of our ideas, I said, keep the word 'truth' for the saltatory and incomprehensible
relation you care so much for, and I will say of thoughts that know their objects in an intelligible
sense that they are 'truthful.'

Like most offerings, this one has been spurned, so I revoke it, repenting of my generosity.
Professor Pratt, in his recent book, calls any objective state of FACTS 'a truth,' and uses
the word 'trueness' in the sense of 'truth' as proposed by me.
