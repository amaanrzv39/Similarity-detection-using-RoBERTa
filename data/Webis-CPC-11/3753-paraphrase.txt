Need men and women today, as in all ages, is to learn to live together in love and peace - to build rather than tear down, to cooperate rather than compete, to find meaning in life through an open exchange with others, rather than by narrow self-seeking.

Religion has always tried to pursue these goals, because they are human spiritual development. But again and again simple truths spoken by great religious leaders have been lost in the complexity of institutions to develop and lust for power.

Friends were distinctive in their stubborn resistance to these diversions and distortions of truth that we simply must learn to love God and man, and that there is no other way to redemption. In each new era, Quakers have found ways to witness how love and peace mode.

May be as a call center for Friends today is to respond to the disintegration of marriage and handing generation finding their marriages, and family relations, a new quality of creativity based on a deep and honest sharing of life? Can love be spread abroad in the earth, where it can not be promoted in close and intimate relationship between man and woman, nuclear relationship where love begins and where does life begin? Maybe proclaim peace between nations, if unable to manage to live in harmony with those under their roof?

Mood of our times is compounded of hope and despair. We achieved so much in terms of technological competence and power, and we have achieved so little, in terms of harmonious human relations. We created the power to make this world compared to what was a paradise for humans to enjoy, but failed to make it possible for man to enjoy what has been achieved.
