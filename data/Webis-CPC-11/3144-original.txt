But something had to be done, so I finally told the despatcher that
Nos. 21 and 22 were in the ditch, and he snapped back, "D--n it, I've been expecting it, and
have ordered the wrecking outfit out from Watsego. You turn your red-light and hold everything
that comes along. In the meantime go wake up the day man. I want an operator there, and not a ham."

When the day man came in, half dressed, he said, "Well, what the devil is the matter?"

Speech had entirely left me by this time, so I simply pointed to the order, and the brakeman
told him the rest. Never in all my life have I spent such a night as that. The day man regaled
me with charming little incidents, about men he knew, who, for having been criminally negligent,
had been shot by infuriated engineers or had been sent up for ten years.
