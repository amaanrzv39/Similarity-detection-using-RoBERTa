It is satisfactory to be
able to record the gratifying fact that this work met with cordial acceptance. In the interests
of serious art, the borrowing of a title from one of the works of a writer so addicted to levity
as EDWARD LEAR may perhaps be deprecated, but there can be no doubt of the ingenuity and sprightliness
with which Mr. Walbrook has addressed himself to, and accomplished, his task. If we cannot
discover in his composition the manifestation of any pronounced individuality or high artistic
uplift, it none the less commands the respect due to the exhibition of a vigorous mentality
combined with a notable mastery of orchestral resource and mellifluous modulation. At the conclusion
of the performance Mr. Walbrook was constrained to make the transit from the artistes' room
to the platform no fewer than three times before the applausive zeal of the audience could
be allayed.

The remainder of the scheme was copious and well-contrived. Pleasurable evidence of the friendly
interest shown in the fortunes of the Czecho-Slovakian Republic was forthcoming in the performance
of two works by composers of that interesting race--Messrs. Dab√ßik and Ploffskin--of which
it may suffice to say that the temperamental peculiarities of the Bohemian genius were elicited
with conspicuous brilliancy under the inspiring direction of Sir Henry Peacham.
