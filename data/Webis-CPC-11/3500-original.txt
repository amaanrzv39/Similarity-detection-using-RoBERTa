It appears to be difficult to get
the tungsten to alloy, and it has to be added to part of the copper as phosphide of tungsten,
in considerably greater quantity than is finally required.  The nickel is added to part of
the copper and the phosphide of tungsten, then the zinc, and then the rest of the copper. 
The alloy requires to be remelted several times, and a good deal of tungsten is lost by oxidation.

The alloy is of a fine white colour, and is very little affected by air--in fact, it is to
some extent untarnishable.  The specific resistance will be seen to be about one and a half
times greater than that of German silver, and the temperature coefficient is about 0.021 per
cent per degree C.  (i.e.  about nineteen times less than copper, and half that of German silver).
To all intents and purposes it may be regarded as German silver with 1 per cent to 2 per cent
of tungsten.  It does not appear to have been particularly examined for secular changes of
resistance.

118.  German Silver.  This material has been exhaustively examined of late years by Klemencic
and by Feussner and St. Lindeck.  Everybody agrees that German silver, as ordinarily used for
resistances, and composed of copper four parts, zinc two parts, nickel one part, is very ill-fitted
for the purpose of making resistance standards.  This is due (1) to its experiencing a considerable
increase in resistance on winding.  Feussner and St.  Lindeck found an increase of 1 per cent
when German silver was wound on a core of ten wire diameters.

(2) To the fact that the change goes on, though with gradually decreasing rate, for months
or years;

(3) to the fact that the resistance is permanently changed (increased) by heating to 40Â° C.
