The unselfish man is he whose nature has a more universal
direction, whose interests are more widely diffused.

But as impersonal thoughts are such only in their object, not in their subject or agents, since,
all thoughts are the thoughts of somebody: so also unselfish interests have to be somebody's
interests. If we were not interested in beauty, if it were of no concern to our happiness whether
things were beautiful or ugly, we should manifest not the maximum, but the total absence of
aesthetic faculty.
