They would completely devour the poor little sprouts, seeds and all. They would arrive in droves. I have in fact seen them cover an entire field. When the went up into the sky the caused a horrible sound. I have seen the sky become dark by the masses of pigeons arriving in the spring. They would converse with one another, preparing to construct their nests, no other sound was audible.

We owned a yoke of old broken down oxen and a untamed pair of steers. Father could only manage the steers by roping their horns and diving into the wagon and let them go about their way. For miles they would go running. They always scared mne. Bad storms would frighten them into a stampede, which made it a tiring job of finding them. A mean storm came up one night when Father was not home. I told Mother that I was going out to secure the oxen with ropes. She was afraid they would harm me and begged me to stay in. I had a plan, I slipped open the gates and when the oxen started through I roped them and tied them securely to the barn. I got in with the aging oxen with ease. I went to shut and secure the barn door after tying them in and I reached behind one of the oxen.The ox became spooked and kicked me. I could not breathe for some time. The iron shoe print was imprinted on the barn door.
In '45 or '46 a few drovers who were driving big cattle droves stayed with our family. They were headed to the north county Red River. We milked the cattle and the stayed in our yard. I hand selected a for Mr. Larpenteur to purchase. I had been the one milking the cows and I knew which one had the best milk. The cow was put in a barnyard that was in a deplorable condition. She cried out unmercifully and wanted to go home.
