The numerous filaments came to be known as protoplasmic
processes; the other fibre was named, after its discoverer, the axis cylinder of Deiters. It
was a natural inference, though not clearly demonstrable in the sections, that these filamentous
processes are the connecting links between the different nerve cells and also the channels
of communication between nerve cells and the periphery of the body. The white substance of
brain and cord, apparently, is made up of such connecting fibres, thus bringing the different
ganglion cells everywhere into communication one with another.

In the attempt to trace the connecting nerve tracts through this white substance by either
macroscopical or microscopical methods, most important aid is given by a method originated
by Waller in 1852.
