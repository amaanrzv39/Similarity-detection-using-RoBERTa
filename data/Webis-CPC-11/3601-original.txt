There is no lack of celebration, however.
On Christmas Eve the churches are crowded and there are banquets and dances going on everywhere.
In the cities the small boys amuse themselves by setting off fireworks. During the Christmas
week dances are frequent, and in the country they continue sometimes for days to the lugubrious
accompaniment of accordions and large drums. December the twenty-eighth, Holy Innocents' day,
is All Fools' day, instead of April the first, it being argued that just as the innocents of
Herod's day were made to suffer, so the innocents of this age should be persecuted. Many are
the pranks perpetrated and the small boy is in his glory. On New Year's Eve many families receive
their friends; there is generally some large ball, and the new year is ushered in with fireworks
and other noises.

The great day of the year for the children is the sixth of January, the feast of Epiphany,
or Three Kings' Day, as it is called in Santo Domingo. Just as the three wise men from the
East brought presents to the infant Christ in ages past, so they now make the rounds and leave
presents for deserving children, thus taking the place of our Santa Claus. The receptacles
they choose for the good things they deliver are either the children's slippers or shoes, or
boxes made ready by the little ones. For weeks before the anxiously awaited day, letters are
written to the Kings, explaining what gifts would be acceptable, and are given to the parents
who undertake to deliver them.
