At this point I stop--for here the fate of Ireland comes to its crisis. This measure was in
operation not three weeks, when the rebels, the traitors, or the people of Ireland, to the
sorrow of every friend to peace, to the Irish name, and to the British connection, stood forth
in opposition to the King's troops. The scene of blood is now opened. Ireland is wasting her
vital strength in convulsion; and whether victory or defeat await them, humanity, loyalty,
and patriotism must weep over the event!
