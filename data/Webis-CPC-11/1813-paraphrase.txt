And shall I find myself thus every time, in each place, and in each state? Shall I forever close with my infidelity the way to Thy providence? Yes, truly, if indeed Thou by Thy mercy do not unmake me, and make me anew. Then, Lord, unmake me, and smash the hardness of my heart, that I be not a tool which spoils Thy works! 
And I beg you, dearest father, to pray sincerely that I and you both together may drown ourselves in the Blood of the modest Lamb, which will make us strong and true.
