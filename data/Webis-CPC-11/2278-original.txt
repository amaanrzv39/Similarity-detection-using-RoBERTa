As a result there will still
be a good path for the lines of force through the iron of the core and comparatively little
change in the number of lines passing through the armature winding. As the corners of the armature
flange pass away from the corners of the pole pieces, however, there is a sudden change in
condition which may be best understood by reference to the right-hand portion of Fig. 71. The
lines of force now no longer find path through the center portion of the armature core--that
lying at right angles to their direction of flow.
