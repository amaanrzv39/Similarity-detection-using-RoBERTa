In the analysis to the quantitative methods are divided: (a) the seriousness in which the component is as an insoluble compound by the addition of some reagents or by electrolysis, by running an electric current (b) defined volume, the volume of a reagent of known strength that a firm reaction is produced measured, (c) color when the solution is a particular color that can be compared with the solutions of known forces.
