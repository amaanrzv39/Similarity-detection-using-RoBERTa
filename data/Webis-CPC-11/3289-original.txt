But it is to another end; for there he promises
exceeding and permanent joy after a sort, though it appear trouble. But here is the trouble
long and vehement, albeit the fruit of it was not suddenly espied. He speaks no doubt of that
long and dolorous time of their captivity, in which they continually laboured for deliverance,
but obtained it not before the complete end of seventy years. During which time, the earth,
that is, the land of Judah, which sometimes was sanctified unto God, but was then given to
be profaned by wicked people, got no help, nor perceived any deliverance: for the inhabitants
of the world fell not; that is, the tyrants and oppressors of Godâ€™s people were not taken away,
but still remained and continued blasphemers of God, and troublers of his church. But because
I perceive the hours to pass more swiftly than they have seemed at other times, I must contract
that which remains of this text into certain points.

The prophet first contends against the present despair; afterwards he introduces God himself
calling upon his people; and, last of all, he assures his afflicted, that God will come, and
require account of all the blood-thirsty tyrants of the earth.

The prophet here pierces through all impediments that nature could object; and, by the victory
of faith, he overcomes, not only the common enemies, but the great and last enemy of all, death
itself; for this would he say, Lord, I see nothing for thy chosen, but misery to follow misery,
and one affliction to succeed another; yea, in the end I see, that death shall devour thy dearest
children. But yet, O Lord!
