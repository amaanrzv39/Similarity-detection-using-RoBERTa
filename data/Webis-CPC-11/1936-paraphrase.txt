This castle we see today is now in ruins. It was built by a nobleman. Mr. Bray, of Derbyshire, says: "This place was taken by Parliament after the Duke went off on his travels. It was then sold and its destruction began, but was bought by the Duke's youngest brother, Sir Charles, and was restored to the family."

The modern version of the castle was built during several different time periods. Sir Charles Cavendish built the north-east end around the year 1613, and to this day that wing remains the oldest part of the castle.
