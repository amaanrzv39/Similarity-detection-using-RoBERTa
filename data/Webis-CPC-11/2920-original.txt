The marines are fighters, have always been so--but it took their participation in
this war to bring them prominently before the public.

"Who and what are the marines?" was the question frequently asked when the communiques began
to retail their exploits. Ideas were very hazy concerning them, and indeed, while we all are
by this time quite familiar with what they can do, there are many of us even now who do not
quite know what they are.

Be it said, then, that the United States Marine Corps was authorized by the Continental Congress
on November 10, 1775, and therefore has the distinction of being the oldest military branch
in the United States service. The corps served valiantly throughout the Revolutionary War,
and was disbanded at the close of the war, April 11, 1782.
