The existence
of arcs between the granules never has been seen or otherwise observed under normal working
conditions of a transmitter; when arcs surely are experimentally established between the granules
the usefulness of the transmitter ceases. The final theory, that change of pressure changes
area of surface contact, does not explain why other conductors than carbon are not good materials
for transmitters. This, it may be noticed, is just what the theories set out to make clear.
