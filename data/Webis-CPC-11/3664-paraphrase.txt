I will not dwell upon my escapades abroad: there is little to interest other people in a recital which awakens no interest in one's self. I looked for for wisdom, and I procured but knowledge. I thirsted for the certainty, the tenderness of love, and I encountered but its feverishness and its falsehood. Like the two Florimels of Spenser, I erred, in my delirium, the delusive fabrication of the senses for the divine certainty of the heart; and I only woke up from my deceit when the phantom I had worshipped softened into snow. Whatever I followed partook of the vitality, yet fitfulness of my nature; mingling to-day in the tumults of the habitation, and to-morrow only with my own heart in the solitude of unpeopled nature; now revelling in the wildest excesses, and now locating, with a aching and unwearied explore, the intricacies of science; alternately administering other people, and subdued by the tyranny which my own passions imposed--I passed through the ordeal unshrinking yet unscathed. "The training of life," declares De Stael, "perfects the considering psyche, but depraves the frivolous." I do not inquire, Monkton, to which of these kinds I belong; but I sense too well, that though my psyche has not been depraved, it has encountered no perfection but in misfortune; and that no matter what be the acquirements of afterwards years, they have none which can recompense for the deficits of our youth.

FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.

I returned to England. I moved into over upon the theatre of its world; but I combined now more in its bigger than its lesser pursuits.
