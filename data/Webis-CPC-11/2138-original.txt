All the powers who believe that they ought solemnly to profess the principles
which have dictated this act, and who recognize how important it is for the welfare of nations,
too long agitated, that these truths should hereafter exercise over the destinies of the human
family that influence which they ought to exert, shall be received, with the same ardor and
affection, into this Holy Alliance. Done at Paris, in the year of our Lord, 1814, September
25, and signed, Francis, Frederic William and Alexander."
