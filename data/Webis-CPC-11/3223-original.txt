On discovering the culprit,
the King upbraided him with his baseness, and pronounced him worthy of death; but, on making
restitution, and promising never again to be guilty of the offence, he pardoned him. "And you,
friend," said he, turning to the monk, "go back to your brethren in peace, and attend all of
you to your sacred duties without fear of me or my army. I am not come hither as a thief to
rob your churches and altars, but as a just and merciful King to protect you from violence."
Henry then proclaimed through the army that no one should injure an ecclesiastic on pain of
death.[162] It was amusing, we are told, to see how the numbers of the regular clergy were
suddenly swollen; rustics       (p. 214) shaving their heads, and putting on the dress of a
monk, to be safe under the terms of that protection.
