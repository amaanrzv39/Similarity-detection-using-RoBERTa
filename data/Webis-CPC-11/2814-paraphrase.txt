At 4:00 p.m. we arrived at Conucos de Siquita which was the Indian plantations of the San Fernando mission.  The citizens wanted to keep us with them but we fought against the current, which by my measurement of watching how long it took a body to float a certain distance, grew five feet every second. Entering at the entrance of the Guavieare at night, we went past the junction of the Rio Atabapo and the Guaviare and got at the mission sometime after 12:00 a.m.  We stayed at the convent, house of the missionary, like usual.  He was surprised at our unannounced arrival, but welcomed us with open arms anyway.
