Their is a variety of things that men agree upon without much thought and without questioning.  Newton completes Gaileo, Maxwell follows Laplace, Helmholtz agrees with Joule but this could also lead to jealousy.  Even best friends, who, no doubt, feel the same, they build up steadily with co-operating hand, but have a different mental effect.  The vista that leads us on, with growing admiration and confidence is the unbreakable solidarity of mankind.
