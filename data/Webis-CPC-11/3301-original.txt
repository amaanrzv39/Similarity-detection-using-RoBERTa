That was the sort of tongue-drill and nerve-quieting
recommended and enforced for many hours a day, through weary months, by a certain Mr. C., while
Dr. P., his successor to the well-named "patient," gave, first, emulcents, and then styptics,
and was fortunately prevented in time by my father from some surgical experiments on the muscles
of lip and tongue. However, nobody could cure me, until I cured myself; rather, let me gratefully
and humbly confess, until God answered constant prayer, and granted stronger bodily health,
and gave me good success in my literary life, and made me to feel I was equal in speech, as
now, to the most fluent of my fellows. So let any stammerer (and there are many such) take
comfort from my cure, and pray against the trouble as I did, and courageously stand up against
the multitude to claim before heaven and earth man's proudest prerogative--the privilege of
speech. In my Proverbial Essay "Of Speaking" will be found two contrasted pictures drawn from
my own experiences: one of the stifled stammerer, the other of the unbridled orator: which
you can turn to as you will. As, however, some of my old groanings after utterance are not
equally accessible, I will here give a few lines of mine from the "Stammerer's Complaint,"
printed in the medical book of one of my Galens:--

        "... And is it not in truth
    A poisoned sting in every social joy,
    A thorn that rankles in the writhing flesh,
    A drop of gall in each domestic sweet,
    An irritating petty misery,--
    That I can never look on one I love
    And speak the fulness of my burning thoughts?
