The chapel has its  site  among the college buildings. There the students assemble every morning for the reading of the  spiritual  scriptures and for prayer; and  onto  the Sabbath religious  facilities  are  behaved   as soon as  the customary  method  of the churches. Studies  within  natural theology and  within  the catechism also form a  portion  of the college course. The religious atmosphere which surrounds the college is as genial and  happy  as the natural atmosphere which  washes  the hills and valleys  round   within  October days. It has  none   component  of sectarianism or bigotry. Free alike from cant, from looseness and indifference, the religious tone of the college is altogether wholesome.
