In the mean time, the whole garrison appeared
in the square, and was ranged opposite the palace: the king, however, expected that the arrival
of the artillery would change their disposition. In a short time, the guns came galloping up;
but to the utter dismay of King Otho, they were ranged in battery against the palace, while
the artillerymen, as soon as the manoeuvre was executed, gave a loud shout of "long live the
constitution."

His Majesty, after a long period of profound silence, appeared at a window of the lower story
of the palace, attended by the Bavarian captain, Hess--the most unpopular man in Greece, unless
Dzinos, the agent in the celebrated cases of judicial torture, could dispute with him that
"bad eminence." One of the servants of the court called for General Kalergy in a loud voice;
and when he approached the window the king asked--"What is the meaning of this disturbance?
What am I to understand by this parade of the garrison?" To this Kalergy replied, in a loud
and clear voice, "The people of Greece and the army desire that your Majesty will redeem the
promise that the country should be governed constitutionally." King Otho then said, "Retire
to your quarters; I shall consult with my ministers, with the council of state, and the ambassadors
of the three protecting powers, and inform you of my determination." This appeared to the audience
to be acting the absolute sovereign rather too strongly under the circumstances, and a slight
movement of the officers, who overheard the king's words, was conveyed like lightning to the
troops, so that the king received a distinct reply from the whole army in a sudden clang of
sabres and noise of arms.
