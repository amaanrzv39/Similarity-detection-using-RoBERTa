I saw some parties coming from Silwa armed with long straight
swords, with a cross hilt. Most men are provided with a dagger fastened round their arm above
the elbow with a thong; others have clubs heavily loaded, or covered at one end with crocodile
scales; and guns are not unfrequent, though powder and shot are exceedingly scarce. Our two
guides, Ismaeen and Abd-el-Mahjid, had each a single-barrelled fowling-piece--value from twenty-five
to thirty shillings. They were both expert shots, as we had occasion to witness when we went
hare-shooting with them. In fact, with their assistance, we had hare every day for dinner during
our stay. They were very chary of their powder, and only fired when pretty sure of success.
