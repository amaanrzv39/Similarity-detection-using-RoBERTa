Standing beside the pyramid, and looking from the base to the top, and especially examining
the vast dimensions of each separate stone, I thus obtained an adequate impression of the magnitude
of its dimensions, which produced a calm and speechless but elevated feeling of awe. The Arabs,
men, women, and children, came crowding around me; but they seemed kind and inoffensive. I
was advised to mount up to the top before the sun gained strength; and, skipping like chamois
on a mountain, two Arabs took hold of me by each wrist, and a third lifted me up from behind,
and thus I began, with resolution and courage, to ascend the countless layers of huge stones
which tower and taper to the top.
