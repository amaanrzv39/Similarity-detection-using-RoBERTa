Today-night,after the end of questions,he quite fortuitually mentions settlement arrived at,and suggested that without deliberation Second Reading of Newfoundland Fisheries Bill shall be accepted."A obsolete form,you perceived," he said,nodding in friendly manner across the table at HARCOURT.
 "Everything is amicably(friendly manner) settled; we certainly won't mention Bill again for three weeks, and then only to withdraw it. Let us read it now a second time just for the amusement of the thing."

Crowded House sat for a moment in a pessimistic disappointment, irresponsive to the hearty presence of old MORALITY(virtuous conduct),who succeeded in looking as if he had spoken something which,though of that not very important,was calculated to be generally acceptable.Actual position was something allied to nature(akin)to what used to happen in St. James's Hall when manager came forward to officially declare that,because(owing) of sudden cold,Mr. SIMS REEVES would not be able to perceive singing. Members stared round as if they were going to ask for their money back;increasingly exacerbating to have OLD MORALITY still nodding and smiling on Treasury Bench. If he thought they were going to subject to the endurance(put off)in that way,he should learn from his mistake;so debate furied over three hours,at the end of which,OLD MORALITY,affirming he would never permit to adjournment of Debate, consented(to approve).

Just at this moment,AKERS-DOUGLAS moved Writ(which a formal document given by a judge) for New Election in the City, and for the moment Members turned from Newfoundland to think kindly of being genial(warmly cheerful),hearty,honest "YAH! YAH!" went beyond the majority.

Business done.--Newfoundland Fisheries Bill shelved(to remove from active service). 

Friday.--JOKIM had another losing equilibrium or support(tumble).Came down with light heart at Morning Sitting,offering to run Budget Bill through Committee.
