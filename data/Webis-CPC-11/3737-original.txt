Beside the principal spear, two or three short spears or javelins, sometimes merely pointed
bars of hardwood, are usually carried in the left hand when an attack is being made.

Beside the sword and the spears the only weapons commonly used are heavy bars of ironwood,
sharpened at both ends and flung so as to twirl rapidly in the air. They are chiefly used in
defending houses from attack, a store of them being kept in the house. For the defence of a
house against an expected attack, short sharp stakes of split bamboo are thrust slantingly
into the ground, so as to present the fire-hardened tip towards the feet of the oncoming foe.

The interior peoples have long possessed a certain number of European-made muskets (mostly
flint-locks) and small Bruni-made brass cannon, obtained from the Malay and Chinese traders.
The latter were chiefly valued for the defence of the house, but were sometimes mounted in
the bows of the war-boats. The difficulty of obtaining supplies of gunpowder has always restricted
greatly the use of firearms, and in recent years the European governments have strictly limited
the sale of gunpowder and firearms; and even at the present day any war-party commissioned
by one of the governments to execute any police measure, such as apprehending, or burning the
house of, people who have wantonly killed others, has to rely in the main on its native weapons.

The equipment of the fighting-man consists, in addition to his weapons, of a war-cap and war-coat
and shield (Pl. 93 and Fig. 26).
