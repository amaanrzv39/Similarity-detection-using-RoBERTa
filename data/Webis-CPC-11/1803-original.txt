I had registered my traps myself,
and was looking out for some one to carry them to the den in which you are penned till the
train arrives, when, lo! the chucker-out! smiling and bowing as if he had never seen me before--"Is
better I retchistar de loggosh, Sar; pity shentlemans like you, Sar, retchistar de loggosh."

I turn on my heel with an imprecation which "Ingleese-spikers" understand. But he still waits
there, smiling, and expecting to be tipped, Let him wait.
