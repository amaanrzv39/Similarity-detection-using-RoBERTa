Part I

The doctor told me in a perfectly cheerful tone that there was no doubt I had gotten, "it".  It was as if it didn't matter.  He said, "it is all over the place" and had seen hundreds of cases before mine.

I resented his nonchalant attitudes.  I didn't ask for him to treat me so callously and brush my concerns aside.  I saw him for only a few minutes, and most of the time he was telling stupid stories that the nurse would laugh at or stories from his war days.
