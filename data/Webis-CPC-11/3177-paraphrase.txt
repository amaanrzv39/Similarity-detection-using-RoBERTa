One of the universal truths in Mr. Harding's eighth edition oh his very worthy "System of Short-Hand," which is very pleasantly illustrated, he adds the "Dirge on Miss LNG,"in which we copied from the "New Monthly Magazine;" however credit is given to Mr. Harding for this current application. A whole number could be written of the MIRROR on short-hand advantages to the community; however this would not be an acquired illustration, so we choose to abstain. Just think of the "Times" newspaper being so far outside of town before half the population of London has risen from sleep; and pondering over the prior night's debates at his breakfast table at Woburn Abbey is the Duke of Bedford. Without the assistance of short-hand what would all the machinery the Mr. Applegath has do towards the production of the newspaper, which does make its journey second to only thought.
