Dr. Morgan in a paper entitled "Moral Philosopher, or a dialogue between Philalethes a Christian deist, and Theophanes a Christian Jew," follows closely in the footsteps of the outer room. Like him, he insisted on absolute perfection of natural law or religion, in which Christianity is just a republication. As he confessed himself a Christian deist and vigorous protest against being considered to be an enemy to Christianity. But his work is inferior tend all respects. It is a poorly written book. It is mainly directed against the Hebrew economy. But Morgan has a much wider range than this, embracing the Old Testament, which he seems to read back finding objects of admiration in what is set before us as objects of reprobation and vice versa.

But though dealing primarily with Morgan Old Testament, he aruncÄƒ considerable doubts third volume in November. Realized the life of Christ, moreover, that of His Resurrection, and above all, through his apostles wrought miracles, all are thrown into discredit. [157]

Overall, this book marks a distinct epoch in the history of English Deism. There is not the word, indeed Morgan, which have not been insinuated by one or other of his predecessors, but it marked the point of being told that now was not only insinuated. The tone throughout the book shows "the beginning of the end", not far distant, that purpose being Lechler what he calls "the dissolution of Deism in Skepticism."

But there is still more to an author whose works have noticed yet been written in previous vein Deism.
