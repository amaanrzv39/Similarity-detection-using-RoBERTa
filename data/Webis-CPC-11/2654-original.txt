If eyelashes are cut in infancy they will
grow longer, but when one gets big enough to wear long skirts and to do one's hair up high
and wear a little bonnet with jet dofunnies on it, there's not much of a show for eyelashes
being made longer by trimming. Touching the lashes with castor oil will increase the growth,
and moistened salt is also good.

THE EYEBROWS.

The eyebrows must be kept well brushed, and by persistent care can be pinched into graceful
lines. A heavy eyebrow can be trained with really little effort. The brush should be small
and rather stiff and firm. It will at once cleanse and invigorate.

I cannot approve of penciled eyebrows. A professional in the "make-up" art can touch the eyebrows
here and there and bring a marvelous change.
