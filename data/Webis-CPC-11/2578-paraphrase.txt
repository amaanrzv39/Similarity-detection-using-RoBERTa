"Aren't  they sent here to spread the gospel to them and to be spirits of ministering to all those who shall inherit salvation?"

When the good designs of God are fell into by happy parents, and with depending on him in the usage of omnisiently appointed means, in the preparation of a group of people to himself, what a beautiful mixture this becomes to complete his wonderful purposes. Not just God--the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, but also the hosts of angels, and all righteous people by their faith and works, help this wonderful design along.

Outside of the ordinary realm, when the fog that blinds us from the unknown is lifted, how strange the feelings parents would have towards their mission here.
