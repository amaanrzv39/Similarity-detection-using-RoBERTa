In some rivers, however, where trout--brown trout, at any rate--will not thrive, the dace does
very well. In the case of the Sussex Ouse this is most remarkable. Little more than ten years
ago there were no dace in that river, now it swarms with them. Their presence is attributed
to the fact that some dace, brought there as live-baits for pike, escaped destruction and established
the present stock. Sluggish and muddy rivers seem to produce the best dace.
