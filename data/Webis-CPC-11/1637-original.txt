The little river was white with surf rushing in
over the bar: not a leaf remained on the bare ground, the naked trees tossed their arms wildly
to and fro, and the pines were coated with ice. A short distance to the west a boy pointed
out some timbers floating in the surf. "Them's the schooner that come ashore last night," he
explained. "This here beach is a bad place in a storm. The crew's all drownded: guess the bodies
will be coming ashore in a few days." We turned away with a shudder.
