As a matter of fact as a human nature and Bibleâ€™s revelation, this is true and it is exactly fitted to the spiritual saying in the Bible. This is an inevitable conclusion which will be followed as per the Bible and its revelation from God to man.  
Where shall we take infidels to get them out of unbelief? 
According to Goethe saying, it is a law of the mischievous spirit that everything will go to their own place from where they had been stolen out.  In fact, this is one of the very important suggestive brilliant maxims.  For example, if a mathematician can make a mistake in a particular problem. Then if he wants to find out the solution, he has to find out the correct answer for such mistake only at the point where the mistake was done by him.   So he has to be in perplexity and search until he finds the mistake and he has to correct it according to his correct finding.  This is a common law which will be more suitable in our each and every good and brilliant operation.    But as a matter of fact, many people will not believe this precious truth?  Now the question is how shall we get them out from such unbelief?
