The koilon is to us non-manifestation, because we have not unfolded
powers which enable us to cognise it, and it may be the manifestation of a loftier order of
LOGOI, utterly beyond our ken.

As none of our investigators can raise his consciousness to the highest plane of our universe,
the Ã¢di-tattva plane, it may be of interest to explain how it is possible for them to see what
may very probably be the atom of that plane. That this may be understood it is essential to
remember that the power of magnification by means of which these experiments are conducted
is quite apart from the faculty of functioning upon one or other of the planes. The latter
is the result of a slow and gradual unfoldment of the Self, while the former is merely a special
development of one of the many powers latent in man.
