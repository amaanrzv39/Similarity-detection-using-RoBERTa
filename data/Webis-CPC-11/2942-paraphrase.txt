The latter is made with much ease from the strings, however the wood industruments do not, in paticular the wood winds. To produce a finely maintained piano from wind instruments is nearly impossible.

The fine instruments have been changed by the players, especially the flautists, into forms of excellency (Gewaltsrohren). The exceptions are our clarinetists, when they choose to use the "Echo Effect," and the French oboists who have kept the pastoral character of their instrument in unaltered condition.

However there is a drawback, which is alive in our greatest orchesteras, proposes a question: why are matters not compenstated at least by the conductors by requiring a richer piano from the strings? But no inconsistency is noticed by the condutors.
