He said going to sea was a dog's life. But I liked it, and followed it up. I think it was in
my twentieth year that I shipped on board the Eliza Ann, Captain. Saunders, bound from Boston
to Calcutta. This was my first long voyage as a sailor. Among the crew was one they called
Jamie, as smart as a steel-trap, and handsome as a picture. He was not our countryman. I think
he was part Scotch. The passengers were always noticing him. One day, when he stood leaning
against the foremast, with his black hair blowing out in the wind, a young man with a portfolio
got me to keep him there, still, for a while: he was an artist, and wanted to make a drawing
of him. The sailors all liked him because he was so clever, and so lively, and knew so many
songs, and could hop about the rigging, light as a bird.
