A big young man is called upon by Hyp, who
asks him if he can whistle.  Told yes, he's asked
to whistle a tune, which he does, but not well.
He sounds like a cushion from which air is escaping.  "If I didn't wake him, his friends would never get to hear that whistle again."

From the back row, a voice calls, "Don't awaken
him, who can stand it."

Hyp.
