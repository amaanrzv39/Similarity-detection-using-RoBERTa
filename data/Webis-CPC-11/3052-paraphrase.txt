MR. JOSEPH S. ROPES'S SPEECH.

FELLOW-CITIZENS,--I want to thank everyone for giving me the honor to be here in this special occasion. We are here all together, not to speak badly of each other, not to abuse the other candidates but to consult each other in a friendly and constructive matter about a very important issue--the public parks of the city of Boston. (Applause.)

Gentlemen, I am a child of Boston; and I remember vividly the good old time. These were the times when the Back Bay was a reality, when the green field dominated everywhere and when our cous were pastured on them.
