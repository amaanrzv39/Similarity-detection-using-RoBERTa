Monsieur Charles Blanc writes: In order to gain a certain sense of how important the arts are, it is sufficient to understand where the great world nations would stand if their monuments that were set up to their faiths and their works that demonstrated their genius erased from history. It accompanies people. After death, only their great emanations that they thought up will stay with us, in other words, while the men die, their art, or literature, poems, writen or inscribed, or any other achievements remain.
