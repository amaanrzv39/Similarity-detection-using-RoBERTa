Due to the treachery of trusted subordinates, I have heard both ex-President Jimenez and ex-President Morales complaining sorrowfully about their fall.A prominent politician, General Luis Felipe Vidal who participated in the murder of President Caceres,though he had only a few hours before visiting the president, played billiards with him and fondled his infant daughter and this was a particularly repulsive case of perfidiousness.
