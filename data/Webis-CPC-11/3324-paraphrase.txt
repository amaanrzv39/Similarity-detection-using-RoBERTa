Thievery was done by her, the same way it frequently had been in the past, on a certain day in the monastery to which Declan belonged. She stole something known as a habellum, roughly translated as a tributary device. She headed home with it, and on her way, a gathering of people caught her up in their crowd both on the road and on the ground. She threw the hidden tablet away, and it fast became a rock that the travelers haded over to Declan himself. He'd had a divine vision of everything that had happened, the female and her comeuppance, and this vision helped Declan's own reputation both among those present for it, and those not. That particular tablet is to this day buried in Declan's graveyard, in his hometown, Ardmore-Declain. Its elevated place memorializes its supernatural connotations.

A wealthy fellow, Fintan, had an infertile wife, so their marriage was a childless one. He went to visit Declan, whom he'd heard would pray for his ability to procreate, and promised Declan both monetary reward, and to be a more moral person. They were sure that Declan had the power to ask God for this, and that his prayer would be granted. Forthwith, Declan did so and gave them his blessing, and told them, "Go forth to your house, and granted the divine miracle, you will procreate." The couple went back, with much excited rejoicing. The next night, when Fintan and his wife attempted to conceive, the miracle occured, and she gave birth to males twins, whom they named Fiacha and Aodh. They, along with their children and their children's children, were forever bound to serve God and Declan.
