of Coburg and possibly even the Princess of Prussia were to add something, I would willingly
surrender my whole artistic activity to these three protectors as a kind of equivalent, and

for myself nor find the proper form for the necessary agreement, but you can, and you and your
intercession will succeed. Possible revenues from the opera I shall write for Paris I might
then entirely devote to the payment of the debts I left in Dresden.

With the confidence of one entirely helpless, I further ask, Make it possible to let me have
some money soon, so that I may leave here, go to Zurich, and exist there till I receive the
desired salary.
