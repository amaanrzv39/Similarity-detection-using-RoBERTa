To search new lands through and
through, or to drag old cities from the graves of centuries, men will advance as heroically
as an army moves to the capture of Chapultepec. Not a flower can breathe forth its fragrance,
though in marshes full of venomous serpents and of as deadly malaria, but science will count
its leaves, and copy with unerring pencil the softest tints that stain them with varied bloom
and beauty. Science will detect every kind of rock in the structure of the most defiant crag.
