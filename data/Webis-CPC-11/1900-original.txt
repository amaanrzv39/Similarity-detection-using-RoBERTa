Sometimes, as in the present volume, the subscription is omitted
altogether and the anchor with the name Aldus alone used. Here moreover the place and date
appear only on the title-page and the colophon is dropped as no longer useful.

The original Greek text of Ptolemy's Planisphere is lost. To the present Latin translation,
made by an unknown hand from the Arabic, is appended (fol. 25) this subscription: Facta est
translatio haec Tolosae Cal. Iunii Anno Domini MCXLIIII.
