(From an Oxford Correspondent.)

The list of the recipients of honorary degrees to be conferred by the University of Cambridge
has already been announced. We are glad to be able to supplement it by information, derived
from a trustworthy source, of the corresponding intentions of the University of Oxford.

The Oxford list is not yet complete, but the following names and the reasons for which the
distinction is to be conferred may be regarded as certain and authentic:--

The Right Hon. WINSTON CHURCHILL, M.P., for his strenuous efforts to brighten Sunday journalism.

Mr. AUGUSTUS JOHN, for unvarnished portraiture and the stoical fortitude exhibited by him in
face of the persecution of the Royal Academy.
