The Kantean rats
were not aware, I believe, when Klopstock spoke thus, of the extermination that had befallen
them: and even to this day those acute animals infest the old house, and steal away the daily
bread of the children,--if the old notions of Space and Time, and the old proofs of religious
verities by way of the understanding and speculative reason, must be called such. Whether or
no these are their true spiritual sustenance, or the necessary guard and vehicle of it, is
perhaps a question.
