It would appear that slowing or stagnation of the blood-stream, and interference with the integrity
of the lining membrane of the vessel wall, are the most important factors determining the formation
of the clot. Alterations in the blood itself, such as occur, for example, in certain tox√¶mias,
also favour coagulation. When the thrombus is formed slowly, it consists of white blood cells
with a small proportion of fibrin, and, being deposited in successive layers, has a distinctly
laminated appearance on section.
