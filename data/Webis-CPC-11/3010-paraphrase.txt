It is not uncommon for gold, silver and other ore veins to extend for long distances, sometimes several hundred miles.  We have found they often exist in side-by-side groups, so it is possible that they exist deeper in the earth than we have explored.  We are unaware of any case where a deep vein has been exposed by erosive conditions, even though it occurs with large, deep impacted rocks.

We have found that the gold veins of Santo Domingo are embedded in quartz and exist in  this side-by-side alignment.  There are great numbers of these veins, in some cases one may be found every 50 yards. Though initially narrow, they may widen to over seventeen feet within a very short distance.
