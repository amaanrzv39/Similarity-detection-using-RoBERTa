I sprang from my chair, "Sir," I said to the astonished FUSSELL, "permit me; I learnt
the art of threading needles as a boy from an East End seamstress," and before he had time
to protest, I had seized the offending instruments, and by a stroke of inspiration had passed
the cotton through. Then without waiting to hear what FUSSELL might have to say, I fled from
the room. And here consequently I sit with my nerves shattered, and an untasted crumpet cooling
on the tea-tray.

Am I singular?
