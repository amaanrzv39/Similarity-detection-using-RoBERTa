With respect to these tables, Prof. Rowland adds: "The substances under the head of 'Not in the Solar Spectrum' are often placed there because the elements have few strong lines or none at all in the limit of the solar spectrum when the arc spectrum, which I have used, is employed.  Thus, boron has only two strong lines at 2497.  Again, the lines of bismuth are all compound, and so too diffuse to alppear in the solar spectrum.  Indeed, some good reason generally appears for their absence from the solar spectrum.
