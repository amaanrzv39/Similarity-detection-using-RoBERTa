The submission
was made, and the court decided in favor of Pennsylvania. But Connecticut gave strong indications
of dissatisfaction with that determination; nor did she appear to be entirely resigned to it,
till, by negotiation and management, something like an equivalent was found for the loss she
supposed herself to have sustained. Nothing here said is intended to convey the slightest censure
on the conduct of that State. She no doubt sincerely believed herself to have been injured
by the decision; and States, like individuals, acquiesce with great reluctance in determinations
to their disadvantage.

Those who had an opportunity of seeing the inside of the transactions which attended the progress
of the controversy between this State and the district of Vermont, can vouch the opposition
we experienced, as well from States not interested as from those which were interested in the
claim; and can attest the danger to which the peace of the Confederacy might have been exposed,
had this State attempted to assert its rights by force. Two motives preponderated in that opposition:
one, a jealousy entertained of our future power; and the other, the interest of certain individuals
of influence in the neighboring States, who had obtained grants of lands under the actual government
of that district. Even the States which brought forward claims, in contradiction to ours, seemed
more solicitous to dismember this State, than to establish their own pretensions. These were
New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. New Jersey and Rhode Island, upon all occasions,
discovered a warm zeal for the independence of Vermont; and Maryland, till alarmed by the appearance
of a connection between Canada and that State, entered deeply into the same views.
