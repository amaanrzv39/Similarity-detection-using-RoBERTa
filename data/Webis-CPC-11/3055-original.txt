Some of these insects
have lately been sent over to Old Spain, and are doing remarkably well on the prickly pear
of that country; indeed, they are said to rival even those of Mexico in the quality and brilliancy
of their dye.

Their naturalization may doubtless be extended along the shores of the Mediterranean, Sicily,
and the different states of Greece. The prickly pear is indigenous in those places, and by
little cultivation will afford sufficient nourishment for the cochineal insects. We are also
assured, (says an intelligent correspondent of The Times,) that these precious insects were
introduced last year on the island of Malta, by Dr. Gorman, on account of the government, and
that they are likely to do well on that island.
