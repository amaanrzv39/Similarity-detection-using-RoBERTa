Tullia.--What! Did we then, who styled ourselves masters of the world, possess only half of
it? The reflection is truly humiliating!

The Savant.--(piqued that Tullia had pronounced his verses bad, replies dryly:) Yes, your countrymen
who boasted of having made themselves masters of the world, had scarce conquered the twentieth
part of it. We have at this moment, at the further end of Europe, an empire larger in itself
than the Roman:[5] it is governed, too, by a woman, who excels you in intellect and beauty,
and who wears chemises; had she read my verses, I am certain she would have thought them good.

(The Marchioness commands silence on the part of the author, who has treated a Roman lady,
the daughter of Cicero, with disrespect.
