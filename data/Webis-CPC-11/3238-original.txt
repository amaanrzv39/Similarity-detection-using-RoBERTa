The sides of the entrances of the three portals are crowded with colossal
statues, thirty- nine in number, representing patriarchs, prophets, kings, bishops, virgins
and martyrs. On the trumeau of the central gate is a fine statue of the Virgin Mary; on the
sides of this trumeau are bas-reliefs representing the Fall of Man, of whose restoration Mary
should be the instrument.

It is quite characteristic of a medieval church that we should find, on the lintels and side-posts
of these doorways, emblems of agricultural work in the various seasons of the year, as well
as different symbols of arts and handicrafts. Amid the carvings of these doorways are the heroes
and saints of the Old Testament, types and forerunners of the Messiah, as well as historic
scenes, representing the Redemption of the World, the Conversion of the Gentiles, the Resurrection
of the Dead, the Last Judgment, the Condemnation of the Wicked, the Reception of the Just into
the habitations of the blest. Finally, the Assumption and Coronation of the Blessed Virgin
sums up, with an imaginative legend, this series of Christian dogma perpetuated in stone.

But the medieval genius is many-sided, and never satisfied with that which is beautiful alone;
and this magnificent array of Christian carving would not be complete to the mind of the medieval
artist unless he had crowned the angles of his buildings with a series of grotesque gargoyles
and allegoric statues, representing the streams that watered the earthly paradise, while at
the summit of the roof are niched angles bearing instruments of music.
