It shall occasionally happen, however, that the installation ought  be recharged or inspected  as soon as nightfall. In order towards  do this within safety, a twice window, incapable of being  unlatched, should be installed within one wall of the house, as far as possible from the door, and  within  such a  grading  that the light may dip   onto towards everybody the necessary places. Outside this window may be discontinued an ordinary hand- lantern burning oil or paraffin; or, preferably, round this window may be  constructed  a  finished lantern into which a number of cause of artificial light may be brought.
