Singular dogmatism that in laying down the law should condescend
to give reasons for it! On the other hand, when I turn to the letter of my friendly censor,
I find assertion without argument, which, to my simple apprehension, is of much nearer kin
to dogmatism than is the sin with which I am charged.

I cannot help thinking that your correspondent, from his dislike "to be puzzled on so plain
a subject," has a misapprehension as to the uses of etymology.
