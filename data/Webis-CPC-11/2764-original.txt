Besides, in the formula to
which the ecclesiastics in the Assembly are obliged to swear in the tribune, the chapter is
precisely indicated, and no exception or reservation is allowed.[2274] The Bishop of Clermont,
with all those who have accepted the Constitution in full, save the decrees affecting spiritual
matters, are silenced. Where the spiritual begins and where it ends the Assembly knows better
than they, for it has defined this, and it imposes its definition on canonist and theologian;
it is, in its turn, the Pope, and all consciences must bow to its decision. Let them take the
"oath, pure and simple," or if they do not they are 'refractory." The fiat goes forth, and
the effect of it is immense, for, along with the clergy, the law reaches to laymen.
