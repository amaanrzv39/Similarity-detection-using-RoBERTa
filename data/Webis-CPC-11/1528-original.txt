Anybody who finds
pleasure in poetic pains may add the other thirteen; to me such a task would savour of bad
luck. Here, however, are some of my brave Rydalesque beginnings, with titles:--

To the ASSISTANT CONTROLLER of FOOD, wishing him success.

JONES, who wouldst keep potatoes for the poor--

To the Ex-PREMIER, now in very active retirement.

ASQUITH, till recently our honoured head--

To a prominent K.C. who has become First Lord of the Admiralty.
