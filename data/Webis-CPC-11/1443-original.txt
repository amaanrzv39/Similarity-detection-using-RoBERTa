Give him to me, neighbor;
for in him I shall have a treasure of delight, and a mine of entertainment. Here we have Don
Kyrie-Eleison of Montalvan, a valorous knight, and his brother Thomas of Montalvan, with the
knight Fonseca, and the combat which the valiant Tirante fought with the bull-dog, and the
witticisms of the damsel Plazerdemivida; also the amours and artifices of the widow Reposada;
and madam the Empress in love with her squire Hypolito.
