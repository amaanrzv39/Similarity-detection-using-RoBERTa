TRaw substances are posted from the site of their starting point   towards the manufacturing establishment that overwhelms them. In a number of instances, these intervals are low, but when Cuba  posts iron ore towards  the United States, or when Brazil ships coffee towards Europe, or when England posts coal towards Italy, the intervals are extensive and the processes of efficient transport are correspondingly important. The equivalent thing holds true of the selling of ceased products. Many of the commodities swung  out via the present-day industry--particularly machinery--are very bulky and heavy.
