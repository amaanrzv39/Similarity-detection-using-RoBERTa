The next day we caught
3 more sharks of the same size, and we ate them also, esteeming them as good fish, boiled and
pressed, and then stewed with vinegar and pepper. We had the wind easterly and we ran with
it to the southward, running in this time from the latitude of 20 degrees 00 minutes to 29
degrees 5 minutes south, and having then 7 degrees 3 minutes east longitude from Cape Salvador;
the variation increasing upon us at present, notwithstanding we went east.
