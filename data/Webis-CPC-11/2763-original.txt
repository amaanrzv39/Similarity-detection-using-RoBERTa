At Charmel the Germans, from the moment of their arrival, entered the houses by breaking in
the doors. They did not leave a bottle of wine in the cellars and they pillaged chiefly the
empty houses, carrying away linen, money, jewelry, and other articles. At the house of the
schoolmaster they took the funds of the School Savings Bank, which amounted to 240 francs.
On the 3d of September, at 11 o'clock at night, they set fire to the château of Mme. de Rougé,
and the same day one of them entered the house of Mme. X., seized her by the throat and violated
her.

At Coincy, on the 3d and 4th of September, they emptied the cellars and sacked the empty houses
and committed outrages on several women in the village.
