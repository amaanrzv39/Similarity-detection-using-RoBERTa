I have already spoken of the summer-sleep of some
animals of the tropics. As the natives know the holes in which the tortoises sleep amidst the
dried lands, they get out a great number at once, by digging fifteen or eighteen inches deep.
Father Gili says that this operation, which he had seen, is not without danger, because serpents
often bury themselves in summer with the terekays.

From the island of Cucuruparu, to the capital of Guiana, commonly called Angostura, we were
but nine days on the water. The distance is somewhat less than ninety-five leagues. We seldom
slept on shore but the torment of the mosquitos diminished in proportion as we advanced. We
landed on the 8th of June at a farm (Hato de San Rafael del Capuchino) opposite the mouth of
the Rio Apure.
