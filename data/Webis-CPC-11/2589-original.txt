And in addition to all this, there must be a revelation
of the divine will concerning human action, for the term worship indicates submission and obedience;
without this, very important elements would be wanting, and the system show great imperfection
and want of wisdom--as man could not learn his relation nor obligation to that great Creator
and Preserver of all. But give in addition the knowledge of man's relation to and dependence
upon God, with a knowledge of his will in the form of law or commands, with promises of good
annexed, resting upon the condition of obedience. Such a system of revelation would be perfect,
fitted to the necessities of human nature. And you, Mr. Skeptic, have agreed with me, that
the nature of man was true and right.
