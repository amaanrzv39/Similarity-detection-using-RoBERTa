A distinguished Russian soldier authorized by the government gave me something else to think about: "Przemysl happened like this.  We didn't rush the place and risk heavy losses, but instead waited and conserved our troops until the garrison couldn't hold out any longer.  That's what the allies decided to do, and this strategy will eventually force Germany's surrender too."
