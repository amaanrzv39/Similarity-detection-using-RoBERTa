My path was under the edge of the woods that fringed a mountain stream. Not the smallest
of the debt we owe the bonny brook is that it wears a deep gully, whose precipitous sides are
clothed with a thick growth of waving trees--beech, white and black birches, maple, and chestnut--in
refreshing and delightful confusion. The stream babbled and murmured at my side as I walked
slowly down, peering in every bush for nests, and at last I parted the branches like a curtain
and stepped within. It was a cool green solitude, a shrine, one of nature's most enchanting
nooks, sacred to dreams and birds and--woodchucks, one of which sat straight up and looked
solemnly at me out of his great brown eyes.

I sat on the low-growing limb of a tree, and was rocked by the wind outside.
