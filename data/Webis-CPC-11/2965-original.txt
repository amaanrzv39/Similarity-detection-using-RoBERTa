He thought that the Russians could not burn Moscow, because the Parisians could
not burn Paris. The French think everything must be French. The Cossacks, alas! do not conform
to etiquette: the rudeness of the seasons knows no rules of politeness! Some artists think
it a test of genius to paint a large picture; and I grant the truth of this position, if the
large picture contains more than a small one. It is not the size of the canvas, but the quantity
of truth and nature put into it, that settles the point. It is a mistake, common enough on
this subject, to suppose that a miniature is more finished than an oil-picture. The miniature
is inferior to the oil-picture only because it is less finished, because it cannot follow nature
into so many individual and exact particulars.
