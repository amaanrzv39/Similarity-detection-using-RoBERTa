And yet
it is a thing so necessary to God’s children, that, unless they are weaned from the pleasures
of the world, they can never feed upon that delectable milk of God’s eternal verity; for the
corruption of the one either hinders the other from being received, or else so troubles the
whole powers of man, that the soul can never so digest the truth of God as he ought to do.

Although this appears hard, yet it is most evident; for what can we receive from the world,
but that which is in the world?
