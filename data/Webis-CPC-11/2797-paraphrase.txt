It was less deep, its best extent down, at the time of the year of utmost water, being but 10 feet; at its higher end it abuts against an considerable swamp, and virtually its every part of foundation, except close to the shoreline, is written of a deposit of pliable, earth colour sheltering, peaty mire of unfamiliar depth. The water is toughly shaded with shade of colour with peaty results, has a muddy variety, and under the rays of a summer sun becomes warmed to 70° (Fahrenheit) at the very bottom.* Yet in such a forbidding position as this, salmon passed the summer in exact health. There were some deficits, but every justification to trust them all to have been produced by damage accepted earlier to their inclosure.

* During the month of August, 1872, the foundation coldness at 1 p.m. was not ever under 70°, and on six days was encountered to be 71°.
