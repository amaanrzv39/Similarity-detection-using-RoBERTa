You are in an honourable profession, which gives
     you occupation.... Resist drink, or a rash throwing away
     life, or wasting in any way the energies of a naturally
     strong, sensible mind, and really attached heart. Now write
     to me soon; tell me truly if I have tried your patience by
     this long letter which I venture to send, for it is when
     returning to life as I now feel that renewed love for all
     dear to one seems to take possession of our hearts, so you
     must forgive it if you find it long.
