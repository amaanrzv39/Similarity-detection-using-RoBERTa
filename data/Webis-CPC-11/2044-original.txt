Here the artist felt and created, there he merely repeated himself.

The triptych, once on the great altar of the church of San Domenico, now at a side altar on
the right, has the Virgin seated in the centre with the Holy Child upright on her knee, his
right hand is raised in act of benediction, and with his left he holds a rose. Around the throne
are four angels, one of which carries a basket of flowers. In the side panels are St. Matthew,
St. John Baptist, St. John the Evangelist and Mary Magdalene.
