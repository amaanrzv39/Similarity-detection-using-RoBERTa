Where they were placed,
there they remain; "and there they will remain forever."

The seventy-eight National Cemeteries distributed over the country contain the remains of three
hundred and eighteen thousand four hundred and fifty-five men, classed as follows: known, 170,960;
unknown, 147,495; total, 318,455. And these are not half of those whose deaths are attributable
to their service in the armies and navies of the United States and the Confederate States,
who are buried in all sections of the Union and in foreign lands.
