There is a way, other than experiment, in which knowledge may be gained. Instead of relying
on experiment (direct experience) for the spreading of knowledge, it is possible to utilize
the indirect channel called education. If this method is followed, and the results of the race
experiment and experience are made available to the young of each generation, the need for
experiment will be limited to a narrow field, since most of the necessary knowledge will be
communicated through education.
