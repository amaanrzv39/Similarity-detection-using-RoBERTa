It was quickly realized that such operations were not sustainable and permits were discountinued. Salmon eggs could only be gotten by the states through Canadian government-controlled breeding programs; however, even then the eggs were priced so high that the establishments were nearly themselves shut down.

It became clear by 1870 that salmon eggs needed to be sourced from somewhere new, somewhere as yet undiscovered and untried. Such a source was found in Maine, where it was thought the Penobscot river might be of use. Though the Penobscot was not as productive as Canadian rivers, it might be made to yeild a hearty quantity of salmon ova.

The Penobscot was studied prior to the start of operations. It was found that the river was approximately 225 miles long.
