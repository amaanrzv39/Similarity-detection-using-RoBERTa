The triptych, once onto the great altar of the church of San Domenico, already at a side altar onto the right, has the Virgin seated within the centre with the Holy Child upright onto her knee, his right hand is elevated within act of benediction, and with his deserted he holds a rose. Around the throne are four angels, one of which shoulders a basket of flowers. In the side blinds are St. Matthew, St. John Baptist, St. John the Evangelist and Mary Magdalene.
