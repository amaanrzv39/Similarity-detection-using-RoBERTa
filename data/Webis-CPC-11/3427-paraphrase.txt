Being in a state of mind without any reasoning' is said to be as  'clear mind'.  We realise or understand anything  only with the matter, that are distinct in nature.   As this is not understood by us very clearly,  this has been named as 'substance'.  Eventhough the word   'substance'  gives the meaning of something that is under,  we are unable to find out the one which is under.This mystery, created by God, exists all over the world.  Nobody knows  how  the birth, the death,  the growth, the digestion, the sleep, the thought and the feeling are all being carried out in nature.

Particularly,the great mystery in nature is the thinking power, which exists in every humanbeing.

SECTION II

The Jaquelot was exactly, the next one in the "Encyclopedia" (the Abb√© Yvon)  after the author of the  'SOUL' , but we can learn nothing from  Jaquelot.

An intellectual, sacred and humble man utters those words.
Everybody knows how much problems he had to face by   his  suggestion,  but we can definitely say that,  this incitement  was concluded by him because of  his  knowledge of the God's almighty power and the inability of mankind. This is not the opinion of him that the  thought is being carried out by matter.  But his suggestion is that we  are not capable enough to deny the opinion that God has presented the thinking power to this  unknown matter.  The nature's mystery of gravitation and movement of the earth are also not understandable

Locke was not satisfied with his all times opinion, who believes that  matter is not confined and it has the power of feeling and thinking.

In adverse to the opinion of  Descartes,  Gassendi has the opinion that we all know clearly what we think, but we cannot understand what kind of group, we belonged to ,being gifted with the power of thinking.
