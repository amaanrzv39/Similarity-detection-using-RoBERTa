Improvements in the methods of applying electricity, as stated on pages 293 to 296, and 300, 329, and 332, which they have not room to copy.

3d. They has introduced the term Faradaic current to represent the induced current, first discovered by Professor Henry, and so much extended in application by Faraday.

5th. The treatment of uterine, and some other female disorders, by means of the induced galvanic current (pages 612 to 621).

4th. The determination of several sure points in sentient and mixed nerves, often the seats of neuralgic pain,--thus correcting Dr. Valleix's painful points.

A careful examination of this book shows it to contain a full résumé of the best which have been written on the subjects embraced under the medical applications of electricity in its various modes of development, as well as a careful analysis of the doctrines of others; while the author has given frankly an account of cases in which they has failed, as of those in which they has been successful. They does not offer electric treatment as a panacea for "all the ills which flesh is heir to," but shows how far and in what cases it proves beneficial. They has shown that there is a right as well as a wrong way of operating, and that mischief may be completed by an unskilful hand, while two who is well qualified by scientific knowledge and practical experience may do much lovely, and in lots of diseases,--more in those of the nerves, such as neuralgia and partial paralysis, in which remarkable cures have been effected. They commend this work to the attention of medical gentlemen, and to students of medicine who wish to be posted up in the novel methods of treating diseases. It is as well as a book which all scientific men may consult with advantage, and which will gratify the curiosity of the general scholar.
