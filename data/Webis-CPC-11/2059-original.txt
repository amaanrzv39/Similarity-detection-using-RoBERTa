Although
dramatic in form the poem is not continuously, directly, and compactly dramatic in movement.
It cannot be converted into a play without being radically changed in structure and in the
form of its diction. More disastrous still, in the eyes of those votaries, it cannot be and
it never has been converted into a play without a considerable sacrifice of its contents, its
comprehensive scope, its poetry, and its ethical significance. In the poem it is the Man who
predominates; it is not the Fiend.
