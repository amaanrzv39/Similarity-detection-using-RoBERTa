The western
half is bordered  by a hilly rampart, broken only here and there, in the bays  where the larger
streams find their outlet, by flat and sandy  plains.  Between Dellys and Philippeville high
mountains rise  almost sheer from the sea, leaving only a narrow strip of  beach.  East of
Philippeville the mountains recede from the  coast, and the rampart of hills reappears.  Only
between Bona  and La Calle is the general character of the sea-board low and  sandy.
