Near the end of 1769, Junius sent a celebrated letter to the King because the publications that criminal information were published about Woodfall, Almon, and Miller, who reprinted the slander.  The "Rex v. Almon" case was the first one brought to trial, which the jury ended up with a "guilty" verdict.  The defense that was used against Woodfall was that the letter to the King wasn't slanderous.  Lord Mansfield's position on the situation is very well known.
