The Arabians begin their day at noone,
    and end at noone the next day; for because they say the sunne was made
    in the meridian; and so do all astronomers account the day, because it
    alwayes falleth at one certaine time. The Umbrians, the Tuscans, the
    Jewes, the Athenians, Italians, and Egyptians, do begin their day at
    sunne-set, and so do we celebrate festivall dayes. The Babylonians,
    Persians, and Bohemians begin their day at sunne-rising, holding till
    sunne-setting; and so do our lawyers count it in England."
