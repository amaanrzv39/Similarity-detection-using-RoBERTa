Large numbers of uneducated natives in our country need to be reached out to and saved, because they cannot be saved alone. Everyone is owed Christianity by those, such as us, who already have it. We must give them the chance to accept intelligent faith. Nearly half of the eight million people in our country are ignorant and weak in their thoughts and morals, but they can be saved. What we have already done is a promise of what is yet to be done; let us dedicate ourselves again to winning peace. Free and large offerings must be made for the glory of Christian love and faith, Christian thinking and working, and for the unsaved who await the day of God's redemption, which is a glory that does not come of sieges and battles.

Will you take Cuba for Christ?
