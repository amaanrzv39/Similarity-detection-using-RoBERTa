This is creditable neither in errand-boy nor poet. Because it had no imagination, but it was cold, the Metaphyical School failed. When Metaphysical poets and writers strayed from the path, they did not do anything dainty as you would think. They shredded imagery with scissors. Because of passionate spontaneity, Shelley was saved! No trappings are too magnificant for the quick seeds of the sun rising over the green hills. The base of his sword may be beautiful and encrusted with rubies and emeralds, but it is the hilt of an Excalibur.  His thoughts burn through folds of expression. His mind explodes richness and you can see through it all to the bare minimum. All that is left is the naked words and poetry.
