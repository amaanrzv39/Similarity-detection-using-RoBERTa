It is however matter
of surprise, that several literary men should have felt such a want of taste in respect to
"their soul's far dearer part," as Hector calls his Andromache. The wives of many men of letters
have been dissolute, ill-humoured, slatternly, and have run into all the frivolities of the
age. The wife of the learned Budæus was of a different character.

How delightful is it when the mind of the female is so happily disposed, and so richly cultivated,
as to participate in the literary avocations of her husband! It is then truly that the intercourse
of the sexes becomes the most refined pleasure. What delight, for instance, must the great
Budæus have tasted, even in those works which must have been for others a most dreadful labour!
