No park can be beautiful unless the trees which adorn it are healthy,
and no tree is healthy which suffers from uncongenial climatic conditions and insufficient
nourishment. Even if they are not inharmonious in a natural combination, the trees and shrubs
which need constant pruning to keep them from looking shabby are too expensive for park use
and should, therefore, be rejected when broad, natural effects in construction and economy
of maintenance are aimed for by the park maker.

The sum of the matter of park construction is to make rural city parks less pretentious and
artificial in design and to so construct them that the cost of maintenance will be reduced
to the minimum.
