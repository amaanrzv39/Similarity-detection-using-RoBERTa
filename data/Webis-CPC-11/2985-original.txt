They will tell that lightning sometimes sets trees on fire, that thunderstorms generally
come after hot dry weather, and that if lightning struck a tree with dry stuff about the fire
would spread, and the long-ago people would run away. A question from the teacher as to what
these people might think about it may bring the suggestion of a monster; if not, one only has
to say that it must have seemed as if it was eating the trees to get "They would think it was
a dreadful animal." Then the story can be told of how the boy called Bodo stopped to look and
saw the monster grow smaller, so he went closer, fed it on wood, and liked to feel its warm
breath after the heavy rain that follows thunder--why had the monster grown smaller?--found
that no animal would come near it and so on.
