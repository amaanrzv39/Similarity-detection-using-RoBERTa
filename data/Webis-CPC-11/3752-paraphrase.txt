To live in peace and harmony today is still the need of men and women as it has always been-- to encourange rather than to discourage, to work together rather than to strive against one another, to seek purpose in life through open giving rather than shallow opportunism.

Religion has striven to advance these beliefs, due to the fact that they reflect the development of man's spirit.However repeatedly  the plain truths expressed by powerful leaders of religion have been lost amidst the intricate grand institutions and the desire for power.

Friends have been distingusishing in their unwilling resistance to these distractions of the mind of the plain truth that we have to learn how to love man and God, there being no other way to redemption. With each new age, the Quakers have developed means of witnessing the ways of love and peace.

For friends today it may be a crucial calling to react to the marriages that are fallina apart and the estrangement of the generations by locating in their own families an d marriages and different kind of reativeness which comes from a meanigful and true sharing of life? Can love be shared around the world, if it cannot grow between man and woman in their intimate relationship, where life and love is created? Can one declare peace among the world in not able to get along well with one's own family?


Our ages mood is mixed with hope and discouragement. So much has been accomplished, in technology; yet we have achieved very little, in terms of peace and harmony with each other. We have been able to make this a world for man to enjoy, but we have not made a world for man to enjoy what we have made.
