If there are evidences of dangerous tendencies in popular thought, or if an infection of the
public mind is being spread by unwholesome reading, the antidote for all this, so far as the
future is concerned, lies in the protection of the young by providing them with a literature
which is at once attractive and wholesome.

This work was undertaken by D. Lothrop & Co. years ago. With the firm conviction that ultimate
success would attend their efforts, they have employed the pens of scores of those who have
shared their convictions, including some of the best known authors at home and abroad, and
have sent out an ever increasing stream of pure, attractive and instructive literature, which
has reached every part of the land, and made their name, famous everywhere.
