It is wonderful the admirable contractors' organisations. The grading works are done by sub-contractors. Messrs. Langdon, Sheppard & Co. is doing the bridge work. They did the srfacing and track laying works and putting the supplies by them. The sub-contractors never expect to haul supplies over 100 miles, but the grading forces were scattered along about 150 miles and the supply stores about 50 miles.
