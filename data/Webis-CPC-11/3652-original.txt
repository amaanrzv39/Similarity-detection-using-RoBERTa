The Benedetto was lying outside
of that sandbank, and that is the torpedo which is lying on the beach. The one aimed at us
came straight, one could see the whorls of the water coming straight at us, but it just tipped
the sandbank and dived underneath our keel. It stuck in the mud then, and the water boiled
over it for a long while."

The mate cut one of the anchors because they were afraid of fouling the sunken torpedo, and
we steamed slowly out from the shelter of the sandbank.

No escort was visible, and soon the sailors began to look anxious. They scanned the horizon
anxiously. At last one cried, "There she is." Far away against the western dawn could be seen
a thin needle mark of smoke. In half an hour we were quite close, an Italian destroyer was
convoying a small steamer. The destroyer swung round under our stern, while the steamer, its
funnels set back, raced for San Giovanni looking like a frightened puppy tearing towards home.
The grey warship surged past us, and out towards the horizon once more, our captain shouting
to them that he could get to Brindisi by midnight. Far away on the sky-line could be seen the
three funnels of a cruiser.

We breakfasted on tinned mackerel, an unlucky dish. The Harmonie, empty of cargo, was like
an eggshell in the water. She bounced and rolled and bounded from wave to wave, half of the
time her screw out of the water. The breakfast did not nourish many. Far on the horizon could
be seen the destroyer and the cruiser sweeping in gigantic circles.
