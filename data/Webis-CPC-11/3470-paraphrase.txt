The Prince was wearing a ducal cap and dress, and sitting on a couch with the cushion supporting the back of his head being covered by delicate sculptures.  His feet was resting on a lion recumbent, his hands were held clasped together, his face turned towards Margaret of Austria, his beloved wife.  On both sides, lovely naked boys, geniuses, cherubs, loves -- called then what you like-- supported his helment and gloves, the same charming statuettes after the same dainty pattern stand at each corner of the sarcophagus supporting his shield and various pieces of armor.  Beneath, a slab of marble, lied the figure of the dead Prince, the finely modeled limbs only partially draped, his long hair curling round his bare shoulders, face turned, as in the first instance, towards the image of his beautiful wife--pose, design, expression, altogehter making up a exquisite whole.  The second master-piece are the Sibyls and other fitures which surroud it.  All statutettes deserving much more careful study, each a precious gem.  The rich Gothic design, on the framework of each noble monument is of Gothic design, elaborate to please the most fastidious critic and very imaginative and finished as far as any artistic finsh could go.  On the right side of the Prince is the tomb of Marguerite of Burgundy, his mother, a sumptuous piece of work, and superbly framed in by Gothic decorative scultures, statuetees, arabesques, flowers and heraldic designs.
