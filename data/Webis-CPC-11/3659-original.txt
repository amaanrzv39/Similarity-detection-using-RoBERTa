Such, sir, is the brief history o' yer auld class-fellow, Solitary
Sandy.

In the history o'

GLAIKIT WILLIE

(continued Mr Grierson), the only thing remarkable is, that he has been as fortunate a man
as he was a thochtless laddie. After leaving the school, he flung his Greek and Latin aside,
and that was easily done, for it was but little that he ever learned, and less that he remembered,
for he paid so little attention to onything he did, that what he got by heart one day, he forgot
the next. In spite o' the remonstrances o' his friends, naething would haud Willie but he would
be a sailor. Weel, he was put on board o' an American trader, and for several years there was
naething heard o' concerning him, but accidents that had happened him, and all through his
glaikitness. Sometimes he was fa'ing owre a boat, and was mostly drowned; and at ither times,
we heard o' him fa'ing headlong into the ship's hold; ance o' his tumbling overboard in the
middle o' the great Atlantic; and at last, o' his fa'ing from the mast upon the deck, and having
his legs broken. It was the luckiest thing that ever happened him. It brought him to think,
and gied him leisure to do it; he was laid up for twelve weeks, and, during part o' the time,
he applied himself to navigation, in the elements o' which science I had instructed him. Soon
after his recovery, he got the command o' a vessel, and was very fortunate, and, for several
years, he has been sole owner of a number of vessels, and is reputed to be very rich.
