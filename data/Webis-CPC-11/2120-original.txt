I had been surprised at first that Anthony, who knew so well the dangers
and mysteries of the East, encouraged Miss Gilder to meddle in so delicate an affair; and there
had never been any explanations between us. But I told myself that his motive was sympathy
with Monny's desire to help: or else he had been tempted to associate himself with her in an
adventure where again, as once or twice before, he had been able to win her gratitude. Perhaps
both motives combined.

As for Mrs. East, she frankly sulked.
