As it were, this gloomy theatre was, visited over and over by British officers and others. A friend of mine told me he watched the performances for seven nights, he is in the Guards and was not pleased.

Capetown has several music halls. I have visited the same type of places in Costantinople,Cario and other miidle eastern towns but none matched the Capetown haunts for rudeness.
