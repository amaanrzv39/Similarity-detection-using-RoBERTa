Mrs. Margery always bits of pulled wisdom from from the day's activities in order to teach her class about life's mysteries.  Today was no different.  As she finished reading a passage on the uncertainty of life, she imparted her musings unto them.  "You should always live as if today will be your last day on earth, and go to sleep at night not expecting to wake up again."  "Don't be sad or afraid, death is not bad, it is a part of life, an ending and a new beginning, a way to move to the next level of life in Heaven."  "So go ahead, be happy, be kind, and be pure, because God is watching over you and only bad people are afraid of death."
