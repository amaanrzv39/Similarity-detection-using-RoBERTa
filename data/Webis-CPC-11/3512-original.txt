The personal impression which he made was very favourable: "A really great man," wrote Mérimée,
"free from feeling and full of esprit." He saw Napoleon again on his return through Paris;
the two succeeded in coming to an understanding. Napoleon assured him that he might depend
on the absolute neutrality of France, in case of a war between Prussia and Austria; it was
agreed also that the annexation of the Duchies to Prussia would not be an increase of territory
which would cause any uneasiness at Paris; Napoleon would view it with favour. Bismarck went
farther than this; he opened the subject of a complete reform of the German Constitution on
the lines that Prussia was to have a free hand in the north of Germany; he pointed out

  "that the acquisition of the Duchies would only be an earnest for
  the fulfilment of the pledge which history had laid upon the
  State of Prussia; for the future prosecution of it we need the
  most friendly relations with France. It seems to me in the
  interest of France to encourage Prussia in the ambitious
  fulfilment of her national duty."

The Emperor acquiesced; as we know, the division of Europe into large national States was what
he meant by Napoleonic ideas; he was willing enough to help in Germany a change such as that
he had brought about in Italy. It was agreed that events should be allowed to develop themselves;
when the time came it would be easy enough to come to some definite agreement.

This however was not all; it was not to be expected that Napoleon should render Prussia so
valuable a service without receiving something in exchange; we know Bismarck's opinion of a
statesman who, out of sympathy for another country, would sacrifice the interests of his own.
