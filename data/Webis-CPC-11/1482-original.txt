It happened
in a case of this kind, that a doubt arose in the minds of the bystanders as to the shoulder
she intended to be taken by one of the friends. They looked at her; but her voice was irretrievably
gone, and they considered that, in so far as this point was concerned, the management had devolved
upon them. Not so: the dying woman could not speak; but with a convulsive effort, she moved
one of her hands, touched the left shoulder, and expired.
