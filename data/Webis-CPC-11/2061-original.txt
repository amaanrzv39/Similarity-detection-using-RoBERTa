There is something
delightful in its old buildings, and even its crooked streets. We forget political and even
religious differences in view of ancient landmarks. We cling to the Old South, and would gladly
have kept Brattle Square with its cannon-ball, whatever might have been thought of its theology.
We cherish the memory of our fathers, and wish to keep among us, as far as possible, signs
of the good old days. This is right and noble; but equally right, and quite as unselfish, is
it to think of those who shall come after us.
