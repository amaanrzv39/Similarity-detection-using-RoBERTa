Now the boy has grown to be a man.He comes to her in his uniform.He said "Ah,these partings!They were really in the death-hour of their dear once.But the woman knows it.They both smiled through their tears   like Andromache

With the brave and silent hearts they both face the sequel together.Every week The mother of  Sub-Lieutenan came to recieve letter from that little boy.That cheerful little pencil was scruggling like this "Dearest Mother, I have dug-out now three planks and a tree of straw, and I sleep on it like a top". or perhaps "You see they have sent me back to the Base after six weeks under fire, and now I have a real, real room, and a real, real bed!" The dear old darling!
