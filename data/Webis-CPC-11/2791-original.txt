Mrs. Margery, who had the Art of moralizing and drawing Instructions from every
Accident, took this Opportunity of reading them a Lecture on the Uncertainty of Life, and the
Necessity of being always prepared for Death. You should get up in the Morning, says she, and
to conduct yourselves, as if that Day was to be your last, and lie down at Night, as if you
never expected to see this World any more. This may be done, says she, without abating of your
Chearfulness, for you are not to consider Death as an Evil, but as a Convenience, as an useful
Pilot, who is to convey you to a Place of greater Happiness: Therefore, play my dear Children,
and be merry; but be innocent and good. The good Man sets Death at Defiance, for his Darts
are only dreadful to the Wicked.
