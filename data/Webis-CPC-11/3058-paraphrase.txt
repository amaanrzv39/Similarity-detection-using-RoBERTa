A rudimentary state of suspect, an incapacity for determination, effects from this paralyzing doubt. The enduring oscillates between the two circumstances of not being competent to play-act (when he desires to), and of being obliged to play-act (when he doesn't like to). The symptom symbolizes the differing forces. These are not, as in hysteria, fused into a compromise-formation, but draw close to split and alternating expression; one set of manifestations, consequently, symbolizes the repressed forces, another the repressing."
