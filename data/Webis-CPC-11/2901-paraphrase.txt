EVENTS THAT LED UP TO THE WAR WITH AMERICA

Madison tried to get a conciliation from the government, but there would not award him anything. The non-intercorse act expired in May of 1810, but a provision existed that, if  either Great Britain or France were to revoke their decree against American trade, the act would protect and restore the powers outlined in the decree if 
cancelled by March 3rd, 1811. Madison was given false information and believed that Napoleon retracted his decrees on November 1, 1810. As a result, the non-intercorse act was reinstated against Great Britain and its empire in February, 1811.

One of the first acts that the Liverpool administration undertook was the cancellation of trade restrictions on America.
