Finally got over my disgust enough to use Maitre Mouche. The first thing I noticed was that his office is much more dusty and musty, much more this year than last year. The notary made his appearance after a moment, her family stiff gestures and shaking his restless eyes behind glasses. I made my complaints to him. He told me .... But why I write, even in a notebook that I'll burn my memories of a scoundrel frankly? He takes sides with Miss prefer, whose sharp mind and impeccable character who has long appreciated. He does not feel able to decide the nature of the disputed question, but he assures me that appearances must have been very much against me.
