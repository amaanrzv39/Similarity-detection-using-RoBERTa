On the second day of his adventures, he saw a mountain and an island at 3:25 PM. He called the mountain "Alligator Mountain," because of all the pears that he discovered there. He made the island his mistress. However, after careful investigation, the discoverer realized that the mountain was merely a mist, and the island a sea-weed. Upon his landing, he received many questions from natives of the area. Thanks to his education, he was able to answer them with this Hamiltonian quote, "Popanilla, under these circumstances, was more loquacious than could have been Capt. Parry."
