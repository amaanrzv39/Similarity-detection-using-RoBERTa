We assuredly believe that the Bible contains all truths necessary to salvation, and that therein
is preserved the undoubted Word of God. We assert likewise that, besides these express oracles
and immediate revelations, there are Scriptures which to the soul and conscience of every Christian
man bear irresistible evidence of the Divine Spirit assisting and actuating the authors; and
that both these and the former are such as to render it morally impossible that any passage
of the small inconsiderable portion, not included in one or other of these, can supply either
ground or occasion of any error in faith, practice, or affection, except to those who wickedly
and wilfully seek a pretext for their unbelief.
