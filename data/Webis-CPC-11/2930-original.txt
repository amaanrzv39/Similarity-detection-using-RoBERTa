In most cases the note E flat is not held any longer than a
forte produced with a careless stroke of the bow will last upon the stringed instruments. Now,
suppose the voice of Beethoven were heard from the grave admonishing a conductor: "Hold my
fermata firmly, terribly! I did not write fermatas in jest, or because I was at a loss how
to proceed; I indulge in the fullest, the most sustained tone to express emotions in my Adagio;
and I use this full and firm tone when I want it in a passionate Allegro as a rapturous or
terrible spasm. Then the very life blood of the tone shall be extracted to the last drop. I
arrest the waves of the sea, and the depths shall be visible; or, I stem the clouds, disperse
the mist, and show the pure blue ether and the glorious eye of the sun.
