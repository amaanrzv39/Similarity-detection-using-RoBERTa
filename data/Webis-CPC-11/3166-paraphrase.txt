I noticed that once rubber was constantly exposed to sunlight it became whiter and the balloon started to lose its strength. I started to use a mercury gauge again.  I also decided, as a precaution, to put cotton flannel over my pad to protect it from the light and anything else that might harm the material.  (The pad is on the roof of the Institute, so it experiences all kinds of weather.) I covered my materials with a rubber b;anket as well, just for a bit of extra protection from the rain and snow.  So far for the last year, this has worked perfectly.  The flat rubber gauge is both inexpensive and covenient, so I am trying to have a black cloth cover one.
