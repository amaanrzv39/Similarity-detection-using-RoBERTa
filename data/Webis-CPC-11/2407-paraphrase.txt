Of his social career I shall not treat since that is  adequately coated elsewhere. To illustrate his financial dealings, the consecutive abstracts of documents are important. In September 1377, the King borrowed L10,000 of Brembre, Wallworth, Philipot and John Haddele (grocer,  afterwards  Mayor of London), and certain else merchants, for whom these were attorneys, pledging the crown jewels.
