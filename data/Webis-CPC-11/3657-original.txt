It was in the middle of the long summer days, and we rambled about through the gardens, and
orchards, and shrubberies where we had played as little children, and laughed over the remembrance
of our childish tricks and troubles. Then there was that long talk with grandmamma, and afterwards
with Bobby, in her room. When Lottie and I found ourselves alone together just at bed-time,
how much we had to say! It seemed to me a little difficult to talk over all her affairs, though
when, after some time, she called upon me to admire my two tall cousins, I was quite ready
to do so. Yet my own rosy, round-faced, romping schoolboy brother was much more in my thoughts now.

I don't think I had ever known till now that my mother was grandmamma's eldest child, so it
had never struck me that, now that dear uncle was gone, Bobby, and not Harry, would be master
of Beecham Park! How strange it did seem! I thought of the funny boy's blushing awkwardness
when grandmamma had told him, and then of his confession to me that "it was a horrid bore,
he had so meant to be a discoverer, and get lost in Africa like Dr. Livingstone; and now, he
supposed, he couldn't!" And just before I went to sleep that night I thought of his last words
about it a few hours ago, as he threw his strong arm over my shoulder:--

"I say, Sis, it'll be ever so long first--that's one comfort!--but if ever I do have to come
and live here, you'll come too, won't you? Then you can see after it all, you know, and then
it won't be quite so bad!"
