The laws of nature didn't create anything. For example, water existed before the laws that control it. Nature could not have created anything, since the definition of nature is the sum of everything. The laws of nature shows there must be some outside force working upon it. Laws do not do anything by themselves: navigation rules cannot steer a ship, gravity cannot move a planet. That is why the rules that work upon nature could not have created nature. To confuse rules with causes is ridiculous. It is just like creating the laws of a country without having someone to execute and hold the country to these laws.
