The sharp
tongue of Mme. de Genlis lost its sting in writing of her. She idealized her as Athenais, in
the novel of that name, which has for its background the beauties of Coppet, and vaguely reproduces
much of its life. The pious and austere Mme. Swetchine, whose prejudices against her were so
strong that for a long time she did not wish to meet her, confessed herself at once a captive
to her "penetrating and indefinable charm." Though she did not always escape the shafts of
malice, no better tribute could be offered to the graces of her character than the indulgence
with which she was regarded by the most severely judging of her own sex.

But she has her days of depression.
