MAY-DAY GAMES.

(For the Mirror.)

 A very interesting thing.This day of joyous festivity has almost ceased to jollity; and the gambols of our forefathers are nearly forgotten amidst the high notions of modern refinement. Time was when king, lords, and commons hailed May-day morning with delight, and bowed homage to her fair and brilliant queen. West end and city folks united in their freaks,joined the merry dance from morning dawn till close of day ate, and drank. Thus in an old ballad of those times we find.

Do you know,the hosiers will dine at the Leg, The drapers at the sign of the Brush, The fletchers to Robin Hood will go, And the spendthrift to Beggar's bush.
