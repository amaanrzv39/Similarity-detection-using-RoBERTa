"We had better go, Mab, you have not given your full lesson time," said Mirah, in a tone higher than usual. "You want to play it again, or will sing for you?"

"You go take care of her, if she does not prohibit me," said Hans, open the door.

Mirah said nothing, and when he opened the outer door for her and closed it behind him, he went with her unforbidden.
