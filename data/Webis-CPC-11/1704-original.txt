The chief cause of attraction and interest in the bridge to outsiders was the fact that it
had been constructed entirely by British infantry without the aid of the Royal Engineers, and
that the plan had been thought out by them alone, and was not "in the book." The idea had been
taken from some photographs of a Cashmere "jhula," and the work had been carried out from descriptions
of the rope bridges furnished by an officer of the Regiment who had crossed them.
