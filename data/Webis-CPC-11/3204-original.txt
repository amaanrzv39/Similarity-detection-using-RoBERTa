has, in seventy years, only about doubled her free population, New-York, in the same period,
has increased hers nearly ten-fold. Ohio, in ten years less time, has increased hers fifty-two

in fifty years, increased hers one hundred and forty fold!]

[Footnote C: Chance threw in our way, many years ago, in Philadelphia, a man whose life boasted
one event. While a boy, he had for some time been sent every morning by his employer to inquire
after the health of 'Mr. TALLEYRAND.' When a few years shall have passed, there will only be
here and there one who can remember having met in New York or Philadelphia JOSEPH BONAPARTE
or LOUIS NAPOLEON.--NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]
