Seeing that you have an ineffable feeling of affection and solicitude toward the word 'true' so , and since you abhor so the tough working of our thoughts, I said, keep the word 'reality' for the leaping and inexplicable kinship you care so much for, and I will say of ideas that know their matter in a clear sense that they are 'reality'.

Like most sacrifices, this one has been rejected disdainfully, so I retract it, mourning for my bounteousness. Professor Pratt, in his fresh book, calls any purpose state of FACTS 'a reality', and uses the word 'dedication' in the gumption of 'reality' as promoted by me.
