Bishop Hugh Folliott also left ornaments and
books. Another bishop, R. de Maidstone, although "vir magnae literaturae, et in theologia nominatissimus,"
only seems to have given the church two antiphonaries, some psalters, and a Legenda. Bishop
Charleton (1369) left a Bible, a concordance, a glossary, Nicholas de Lyra, and five Books
of Moses, all to be chained in the cathedral. Very shortly afterwards we hear of fittings,
for in 1395 Walter of Ramsbury gave L 10 for making the desks. Probably a book-room, which
was over the west cloister, was then put up. A long interval elapsed, during which little seems
to have been done for the library. But between c. 1516-35 Bishop Booth and Dean Frowcester
left many fine volumes.
