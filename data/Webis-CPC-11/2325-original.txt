She
hid in the copse like a wary cricket, And the fleetest hunters in vain pursue. Seeing unseen
from her hiding place, She sees them fly on the hurried chase; She sees their fierce eyes glance
and dart, As they pass and peer for a track or trace, And she trembles with fear in the copse
apart. Lest her nest be betrayed by her throbbing heart.

Weary the hours; but the sun at last Went down to his lodge in the west, and fast The wings
of the spirits of night were spread O'er the darkling woods and Wiwaste's head.
