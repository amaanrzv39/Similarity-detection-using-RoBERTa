I had had the upper berth pushed up so as to get
the air! Again the train came to an unscheduled stop. By this time assorted heads were emerging
from behind the curtains, and from each came forcible protests against the weather. There was
nothing to be done but to sit with my feet tucked up and my arms around my knees, occupying
thus the smallest possible space for one of my proportions, and wait developments. Ten minutes
later, after much shouting outside my window, a ladder was planted against the car, and two
trainmen in yellow oilskins climbed to the roof. I noted with satisfaction that they carried
hammers, tacks, and strips of tin. A series of resounding blows and the almost immediate cessation
of the descending floods told how effective their methods had proved.
