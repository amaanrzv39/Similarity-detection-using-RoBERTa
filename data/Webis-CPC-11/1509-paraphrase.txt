The claims of human duty are  benevolence,suffering and disappointment. Forgotten in sleep, press with new weight on weary hearts. One hour has made mighty changes.   
   During night heathenism and wickedness will rule over. But once morning comes everything will be bright. Similarly nations once wrapped in gloom are waking to life and truth.
