To-day at the head of ten thousand men, the next day wandering with a score
of horsemen, it is very rare that one can come up with him. When we believed him to be in our
front, he was in our rear. Yesterday he threatened such a post, to-day he is ten leagues from
it; more able to avoid than fight us, he almost always disconcerts, and often, without knowing
it, all our combinations. He endeavours to surprise us, to carry off our patroles, and to kill
our stragglers".
