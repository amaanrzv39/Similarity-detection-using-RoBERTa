Make certain that you know that Germany will not be defeated. They will fight until their last man and their last dollar is gone.

Also be aware that success for Germany - in political and economic circles - goes hand in hand with success for America.

Please make your fellow citizens aware that Germany - unlike her bitter enemies Russia, France and Belgium - have always protected her loyal citizens and wonderful culture. If you circulate this short memorial amongst your friends and fellow citizens, you will help to spread the truth of Germany's battles and victories. All of Germany wishes you to have a safe happy voyage home.
