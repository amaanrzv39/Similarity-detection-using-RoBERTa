Within one quarter of an hour came
the Judges, presently his Majesty, who spoke excellently well, and majestically, without impediment
in the least when he spoke. I saw the silver top of his staff unexpectedly fall to the ground,
which was took up by Mr. Rushworth: and then I heard Bradshaw the Judge say to his Majesty,

'Sir, instead of answering the court, you interrogate their power, which becomes not one in
your condition'--

These words pierced my heart and soul, to hear a subject thus audaciously to reprehend his
Sovereign, who ever and anon replied with great magnanimity and prudence.

After that his Majesty was beheaded, the Parliament for some years effected nothing either
for the publick peace or tranquillity of the nation, or settling religion as they had formerly
promised.
