Only the older generation of jews knew Hebrew,whereas the younger generation of jews do not knew even the single word of this particular language(Hebrew).Therefore the younger generation of jews had lack of knowldge in the name of god.

For the jewish boys and girls the sacred writing of old or new testament would be the only safe gaurd.In the case of people speaking greek the bible should be translated in that particular language so that they can understand it,vice versa for other languages also.

Jews changed their language and county.The largest library in the world holding Bible translation books is Alexandria.All these without without name of God, does not exist.
