Menorah movement is welcome as evidence of a new order in the life of the young college Jew. He came to see finally that is funny, in large part to stay out of the Greek letter fraternities of the Greeks and barbarians, it is tragic, in large part, to shut out life their own people. This is from his own people that should take your vision and support spiritually, if you want to live a life of self-control rather than the life of a despicable parasite roots chameleonizing anywhere and everywhere. There was a time when his fellow Jews excuse half the men of the university, who left the life of Israel, as if the burden of the security Jews were too much for the shoulders and unproven unrobust of our Jewish college men as if their intellectual and moral squeamishness led the rebellion against the inevitable association with his fellow Jews so despised and misunderstood completely. Now we see, and our younger brothers of the scholarship Menorah have caught the vision that no Jew can be truly educated Jewishly is uprooted, the man who rejected the birthright of inheritance of the traditions of the first and virilest of civilized nations of earth leads to the impoverishment of their own being. The Jew is a Jew "small" is less a man.

The Menorah lights the way for the fellowship of the youth of Israel, or self-reverence. Long light obscured revived!
