The matter was settled by the doctor’s opinion.  It was that Ella should stay and Mr. Hastings to make things easy for her, summoned his servants, and explained to them that his daughter was vested with the duty of taking charge of the house.  Till the time Mrs. Wilson has got well enough to take care of things herself, the servants were to take the orders of Ella and refer every matter to her as well.
Everything went smoothly at first; since the servants were concerned about Mrs. Wilson’s illness they were ready to help and oblige.  Ella too found it challenging and time pass quickly unlike what she expected it to be.  Instead of the days seeming dull, actually there were too much of thinking and doing.
She arranged an interview immediately after breakfast, with the nurse to get the report and took a consultation as to the cookery for the invalid for the day.
