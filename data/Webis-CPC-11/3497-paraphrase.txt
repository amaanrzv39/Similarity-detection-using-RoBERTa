Can't anything be done to save the fish swimming in the Connecticut River?  There are companies manufacturing paper from logs in Holyoke, Mass. and Windsor Locks, Conn. I'm told that these companies dump chemicals into the river twice a day and it is affecting our fish population.

These factories are located at the bottom of falls and this is where schools of fish swim. The sand-bars and river shores are lined with fish that have died from the chemicals being released into the water. There were three salmon found within two miles of my office that were thought to weigh 12, 20 and 25 pounds!). There are so many dead fish lining the river's edge that eagles are swooping in for them. In fact, at least nine eagles have been shot over the past two seasons.

I am writing to you in hopes that the Fish Commissioner might stop these factories from dumping their deadly chemicals into the river. Please save the fish in our river!

Yours truly,

Dear Sir,

I am sending you remarks in regards to the Restigouche and Saint Croix Rivers. These remarks may be somewhat crude but they are either taken from official statistics or are facts that I am aware of. If they are useful, feel free to publish any of them.

I would like to obtain some young shad for the Saint Croix River. The elder generation believe the shad are much better food than salmon. This fish was very abundant at one time. Restocking the Saint Croix with shad could be successful like it was in the Connecticut River.
