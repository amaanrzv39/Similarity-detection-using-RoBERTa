A good old adage question very clearly: "A boy is a boy, two boys are half a boy, and three boys are all boy!"

It's actually ridiculous townspeople, lawyers, and to legislate for producers of farm work, they do not understand that work inside the workshop or factory, under regular and invariable material is completely different from working in the door , changing seasonal conditions, weather, and cultures treated with results. An old maxim of Worcestershire worker who, without a fixed place, the piece was a particularly busy working hours, will confirm this: "Go to a good wheat farmer hoeing, and one evil for harvest . Might explain that the areas are clean and good farmer almost free of weeds, so weeding is a relatively easy job, but equally, or almost the same price per acre paid by the farmer is bad, maize which is overrun by weeds, which involves more time and work harder. On the other hand, good wheat crop farmer is more difficult than the sick, and is cutting prices again very similar, more money can be earned per diem when the latter's farm harvest.

Worcestershire is a sound old saying that "time to hoe is when there are weeds" - apparently a paradox, but the meaning is simple: when there are weeds to be seen above ground there are always millions of young seedlings just below the surface ready to grow and multiply with a great shower of rain, when attacked in the seedling stage, they can be slaughtered in battalions, with much greater ease and effectiveness than when they are deeply rooted and established, and dominate the culture.
