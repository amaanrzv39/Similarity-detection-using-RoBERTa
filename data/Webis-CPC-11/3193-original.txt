                  MECHANICAL ENLARGEMENT OF DESIGNS.

The simplest way is to enlarge by the eye, as the artists do. One method is to divide the whole
design into squares and rule off the paper to be enlarged in corresponding squares of larger
size. Each portion within the square is then exactly reproduced, copying the portion in the
smaller square. For embroidery designs especially we should think this would be very good.

                             DRY STAMPING.

This is done by a process known as pouncing. The process is as follows: Place the pattern (rough
side up) on the material to be stamped, placing heavy weights on the corner to keep it from
slipping; then rub the powder over the perforations with the pouncet or distributor described
below till the pattern is clearly marked on the material.
