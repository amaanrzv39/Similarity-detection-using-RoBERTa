It is called "The Angel's
spire," from the fact that poised upon its summit is an angel covered with gilt and holding
aloft a cross. This turret rises 59 feet above the roof of the church. The church itself is
486 feet in length, and from the vaulting of the roof to the pavement is 125 feet. The towers
are 272 feet high. I noticed the church is built in the form of a cross, but the transept is
very close to the apse, so that the choir being too confined for the great ceremonies, such
as that of royal coronations, which used to take place there, has been extended westward across
the transept so as to take up three bays of the nave.

There are seven chapels at the east of the church, but none are found in the naves.
