Such a boy he was in his youth! There was no mischief that he wouldn't get in to in order to get some fruit! She was rambling on about Tom's younger years. Listening happily to her stories, the two men responded to her inquiries, sharing a smile at random moments. As the train neared the station, the train's ticket collected informed the elderly woman that tickets would be collected at the end stop.

The eldery woman said, "Thank You for informing me so I would know to have my ticket ready, which I have put away safely. It was quite expensive for a trip to London, but Tom wanted me to come as I am his mother." She opened her handbag, took out paper which contained her ticket, and then returned the paper to her purse. She gently held the ticket in her gloved fingers, as if it were somehow breakable.

"Such a differenr mannerism to the ways of our city!, the Stockbroker thought.

"That shows such great character!" were the thoughts of the ticket holder.

"Oh My! One of my hair pins have come loose" said the elderly woman, which was quite sudden. She reached back quickly with the hand holding the ticket to secure the pin in place.

In an instant, the elderly woman had a look of panic upon her face. Her appearance showed of fear and anxiety. She uttered out some words that could not be heard or understood.

"May I ask what is wrong?" the Stockbroker inquired.

"I've lost my ticket!" As I was securing my hair pin, the ticket must have fallen from my fingers and dropped down between my body and my clothing"
