HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:

IT IS sometimes asked, with an air of seeming triumph, what inducements could the States have,
if disunited, to make war upon each other? It would be a full answer to this question to say--precisely
the same inducements which have, at different times, deluged in blood all the nations in the
world. But, unfortunately for us, the question admits of a more particular answer. There are
causes of differences within our immediate contemplation, of the tendency of which, even under
the restraints of a federal constitution, we have had sufficient experience to enable us to
form a judgment of what might be expected if those restraints were removed.
