We are so concerned with the effect of our religion
upon the community that we have forgotten that the heart of religion is found in the solitary
soul. All of which means that we have here again yielded to the time spirit that enfolds us
and have come to think of man as religious if he be humane. But that is not true. No man is
ever religious until he becomes devout. And indeed no man of our sort--the saint and sinner
sort--is ever long and truly humane unless the springs of his tenderness for men are found
in his ever widening and deepening gratitude to God! Hence no man was ever yet able to preach
the living God until he understood that the central need in human life is to reconcile the
individual conscience to itself, compose the anarchy of the spiritual life.
