Hey you people who stand by Darwin's theories of evolution, you need to leave, all of you.  You're opinions have turned Haeckel into a mindless fool.  After all, was it not he that stated in order for anyone to speak and be heard on evolution from the primordial ooze, they must place their entire existence in the hands of science, renounce all religious beliefs such as God, the Bible, the soul, and eternal life, and draw the clueless conclusion that you have no idea where you came from.  Once these are accomplished, then speak and be heard.  Mr. Haeckel is a smart man, one of which should be heeded.
