The men from Silwa bore cross-hilted swords, most with a dagger fastened above the elbow; others still have clubs scaled or spiked; and it is not unknown to find guns; though the shot and powder needed for their use is far more rare. Ismaeen and Abd-el-Mahjid, our guides, both carried single-barrelled fowling-pieces and were expert shots, as we saw when we witnessed them shooting hares. In fact, thanks to them we ate hare every evening. They were cautious with their limited powder supplies and would only fire when sure of making a hit.
