I do not thin my apples; enough fall off. I fertilize
my orchard by mowing the clover, and think it beneficial to young trees, and would advise the
use of clover fertilization on all soils. I do not pasture my orchard; is not advisable. My
trees are troubled with borers, and my apples with some insect that stings them and causes
them to fall off. I do not spray. I pick my apples by hand with care. Sort into two classes,
pack in barrels, in layers, by hand, mark with variety, and haul to shipping place or market
in lumber wagon. I wholesale my best apples; make vinegar of the second and third grades and
culls. Topeka is my best market; never tried distant markets. I do not dry any. I am successful
in storing apples in barrels in a cellar; I also bury some. I find Romanite keeps best. I have
to repack stored apples before marketing, losing about one-eighth of them. I do not irrigate.
Price has been fifty cents per bushel.

THOMAS BUCKMAN, Topeka, Shawnee county: I have lived in the state twenty-nine years. Have an
apple orchard of 1300 trees from six to twenty-seven years old. For market I prefer Ben Davis
and Jonathan; and for family orchard Rare Ripe, Maiden's Blush, and Winesap. I prefer black
soil with a porous subsoil, and a northeast slope. I prefer two-year-old, small-size trees,
with good roots, set in holes dug with spade in well-cultivated ground. I cultivate my orchard
six years with a five-tooth cultivator; plant corn in a young orchard, and cease cropping when
six years old, and sow clover in the bearing orchard. Windbreaks are essential; would make
them of Osage orange, by setting the plants twelve inches apart. For the rabbits I use traps
and wrap the young trees with corn-stalks.
