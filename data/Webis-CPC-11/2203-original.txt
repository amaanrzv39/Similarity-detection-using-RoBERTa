In the crises of his past life,
he tells us, he had found that no aid had been forthcoming either from man or any supernal
power. "We must tread the wine-press alone." Only in one source had he discovered a stay and
stimulus, which brought him the sense of individual self-subsistence--in the exercise of such
creative talent as nature had bestowed upon him. Of this consciousness, no external power could
deprive him, and it is this consciousness that is the governing idea of the fragment, and not
the Titanism of the Prometheus of Ã†schylus.
