Is a moneron an eternal life germ? No. Neither Haeckel or Darwin advocates
such a foolish idea; nor yet the idea of life-germs always existing. Life-germs are material
organisms, and they may be alive or dead; for we know there is no period in the history of
a living organism when it is not liable to die.

Spontaneous generation does not correlate with the idea that "life-germs always existed." And
it is also opposed to the Christian idea that all life is from God, the eternal, ever-living
spirit.
