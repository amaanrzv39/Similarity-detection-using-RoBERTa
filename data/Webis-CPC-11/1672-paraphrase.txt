Imberlach

Imberlach requires two cups of matzoth flour, a quarter pound of powdered ginger, and three eggs.  Mix all the ingredients together.  Set aside the dough until it is dry, then take half a pound of honey and three-fourths a pound of sugar and boil them together.  Wait for the boiling mixture to turn reddish, remove from heat, and then add the dough and put it back on the stove.  Stir constantly until the mixture is thick and reddish, then take it out of the pot and place it on a cutting board to cool.  Finally roll out the cooled dough mixture and cut into two inch pieces.
