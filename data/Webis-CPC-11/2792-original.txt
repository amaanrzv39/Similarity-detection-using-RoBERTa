I call them hoary, because they
had been built more than fifty years. To me they seemed uncommonly hoary, and I snuffed antiquity
in the dusty purlieus. I now began to study, in good earnest, the wisdom of the past. I saw
clearly the value of dead men and mouldy precepts, especially if the former had been entombed
a thousand years, and if the latter were well done in sounding Greek and Latin. I began to
reverence royal lines of deceased monarchs, and longed to connect my own name, now growing
into college popularity, with some far-off mighty one who had ruled in pomp and luxury his
obsequious people. The trunk in Snowborough troubled my dreams. In that receptacle still slept
the proof of our family distinction.
