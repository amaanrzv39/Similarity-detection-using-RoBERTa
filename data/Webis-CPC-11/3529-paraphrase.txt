I beg to suggest a few observations for the improvement of works of this description through your valuable channel. 

I. I submit that none of the dictionaries of reference now specified should be published without promise of a periodical supplement every five or seven years, containing later matter and intelligence. For example, how easily could this be given in the case of a Biographical Dictionary! Say that such a work has been published in 1830 (which, it is believed, is the date of Gorton's excellent Biographical Dictionary), the compiler of a supplement has only to collect and arrange monthly or annual obituaries of the common magazines since 1830 to make a good and useful supplemental volume. 

II. I would suggest to skilful authors and booksellers publishing Biographical Dictionaries to follow the French and American custom of including in them the more eminent contemporary living characters. That would add greatly to the use of the book; and the matter could easily be collected from the current Books of Peerage and Parliamentary Companions, with aid from the numerous magazines as to distinguished literary men. 

III. The supplements for Gazetteers could be easily compiled from the parliamentary papers and magazines of the day. I would refer particularly to the supplements published by Mr. McCulloch to his Commercial Dictionary as an example to be followed; while the conduct lately adopted in the new edition of Maunder's Biographical Treasury should be avoided.
