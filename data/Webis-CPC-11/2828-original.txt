Now,
though it is a just cause of regret that we do not see better homesteads and better fences
in Ireland, still we cannot admit that the tenant's being obliged to keep such as exist in

thing on them: he does not even expend his own labour on their improvement; and his time, which
might be profitably occupied in this way, is wasted in useless idleness, in swelling the train,
or cheering the ferocious sentiments, of some mercenary agitator.

Having shown, as correctly as it is possible to do, the relative amount of rents paid in England
and in Ireland, let us compare the amount of rents paid in each of the Irish provinces.
