Prince Repnin, dreamed of a church that exceeds all others, a Greek church, which abounds in forms and ceremonies, had so little regard for the forms of his religion: in which he would order a play to be acted on Ash Wednesday at Warsaw. Towards Christmas 1767, Lord Malmesbury and Mr Harris was at the house of a Polish nobleman during the hunting season. He stated to the king that he had never seen him in better spirits. "Ah!" was the answer of the king, "it is very pleasant to delude one's self sometimes."
