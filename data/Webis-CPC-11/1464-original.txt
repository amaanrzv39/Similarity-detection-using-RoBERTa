APOLOGY FOR THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 1793.

MY LORD,

Reputation may not improperly be termed the moral life of man. Alluding to our natural existence,
Addison, in a sublime allegory well known to your Lordship, has represented us as crossing
an immense bridge, from whose surface from a variety of causes we disappear one after another,
and are seen no more.
