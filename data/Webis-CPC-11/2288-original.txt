I know not what the gentleman calls an
expression of the public will.  There were two candidates for the office of President, who
were presented to the House of Representatives with equal suffrages.  The constitution gave
us the right and made it our duty to elect that one of the two whom we thought preferable.
A public man is to notice the public will as constitutionally expressed.  The gentleman from
Virginia, and many others, may have had their preference; but that preference of the public
will not appear by its constitutional expression.
