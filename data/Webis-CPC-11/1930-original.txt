It is a disease, and, what is most distressing,
it is no real change; it is more sickeningly monotonous than absolute stagnation itself. And
from that dreary seesaw I could never escape, except through the gates of dreamless sleep,
the death in life; for even in our dreams we are still ourselves. There was no rest!

I loathed the very sight of myself in the shop-windows as I went by; and yet I always looked
for it there, in the forlorn hope of at least finding some alteration, even for the worse.
