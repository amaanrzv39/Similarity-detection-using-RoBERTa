His intellect clear, positive convictions, his boundless energy, and his ardent enthusiasm, gave him a powerful influence on the early days of the revolution, looking towards a world rebuilt, but plunged into the dark depths of chaos and is through this that we made a name among the women of France said. In more peaceful times peculiar talent, no doubt, led him to literature. In his best style she has an unusual force and simplicity. It has moments of eloquent thought. There are flashes of her in his letters soon to Sophie, who begs her friend not to burn, but she does not expect rival Mme. de Sevigne, whom he takes for his model. She lacked the grace, lightness, wit and humor of this model, but had a serious, serious depth of thought that one does not find in Mme. de Sevigne. There was also a vein of sentiment that was an underlying force in his character, but always subject to male intellect. She confesses that she wanted to be the chronicler of his country, and yearns for the pen of Tacitus, for whom she has a true passion. When you read his sharp, incisive pen-portraits, drawn with a vision so profound and masterful skill, one feels that his true calling was in the world of letters. In the fence that borders a bit on stage, as sometimes in his youth. But when she wrote her final record his last hours he was running away. Life, with its large undeveloped possibilities and promises, was behind it. The darkness was around him, the eternal silence before her. She had lived, but thirty-nine. 

Mme. Roland does not belong to the world of the salon, although she has been included among them some of their own cotemporaries.
