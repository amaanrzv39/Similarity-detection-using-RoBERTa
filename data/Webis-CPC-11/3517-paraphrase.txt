The protection of merchant ships was undertaken by the navy. The laurels accruing  to this department is won by the naval gun crews .
          The task of administration for connecting these vessels is considerably high.The armed merchant men have an attraction for publishing their services. If they have not done this the importance and glory of the naval service in war could not have been counted. They may be considered as deck of destroyer or just patrol-vessel.
       The navy operated the transportation of the soldiers  to overseas. EVenthough a single transport have notlost their way three vessels have been sunk while returning.Usually  Submarines attacked  the transport on their way to Francee.  Like this our first transport convoy was attacked unsuccessfully as in the case of last twelve months. Tuscania  with American soldiers was attacked by a submarine . This vessel was under the control of the British Navy. However this does not imply blame on them as it is very hard to protect the ocean lanes. It happens eventhough they were well convoyed we cannot totaly banish the lurking torpedoes. We should also remember The British have sixty percent of our expeditionary forces across the ocean.
