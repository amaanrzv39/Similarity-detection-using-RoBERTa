It is needless, perhaps, to repeat what has been said so often in the columns of this journal,
that in our judgment the greatest value and only justification of great urban parks exist in
the fact that they can bring the country into the city and give to people who are obliged to
pass their lives in cities the opportunity to enjoy the refreshment of mind and body which
can only be found in communion with nature and the contemplation of beautiful natural objects
harmoniously arranged.
