Both these signs, I had been told,
meant that I was quite close to the town; so I took a short cut up through the forest over
a spur of hill--a short cut most legitimate, because it was trodden and very manifestly used--and
I walked up and then on a level for a mile, along a lane of the woods and beneath small, dripping
trees. When this short silence of the forest was over, I saw an excellent sight.

There, below me, where the lane began to fall, was the first of the German cities.
