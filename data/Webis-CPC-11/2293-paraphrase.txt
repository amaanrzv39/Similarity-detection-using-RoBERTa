"But listen to what one of them is saying."

The prophet has a message of warning:

"Didn't I warn you for three years that Aplean, who you trusted, was just a servant of his father, the Devil?  Didn't I tell you that he worked to alter your minds and imagination so he could keep you from 'The God of Salvation' and that he set up his own image to be worshipped on that mountain over there?"
