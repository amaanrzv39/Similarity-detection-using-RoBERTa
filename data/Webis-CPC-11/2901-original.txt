Madison attempted to obtain concessions

In May, 1810, the non-intercourse act expired, but a proviso was enacted that, if before March
3, 1811, either Great Britain or France should cancel her decrees against American trade the
act should, three months after such revocation, revive against the power that maintained its
decrees. Madison was cajoled into believing that Napoleon had recalled his decrees on November
1, 1810, and the non-intercourse act was accordingly revived against Great Britain and her
dependencies in February, 1811.

Almost the first act of the Liverpool administration was to cancel the restrictions on American
trade.
