My third reflection is, that the main cause of our civil war is slavery. It has now
assumed gigantic proportions of mischief, and with its hand upon the very throat of the Constitution
and the Union, it seeks its death. The worst feature connected with it has ever been, that
it is satisfied with no concession, and the more it has, the more it asks. By the very admission
of the chiefs of this rebellion, it is confessedly got up for the sake of slavery, and to make
it the corner-stone of the new Confederacy of States. The real issue involved by the rebellion
is, complete independence of the North, the dissolution of the Union, and exclusive possession
of all the territories south of Mason and Dixon's line; or reconstruction upon such conditions
as would result in the repudiation of the old Constitution, the nationalization of slavery,
and giving complete political control to a slaveholding minority of the country. This rebellion
has placed the North where it must conquer, for its own best interests, and dignity, and the
salvation of free institutions. It must conquer, to command future friendship and that respect
without which Union itself is a mockery. Let the South see that the North can not be beaten,
and the universal consciousness of this fact will command an esteem, and the useful fear of
committing offense, that will do more to keep the peace than all the abject professions or
humble submissions in the world.
