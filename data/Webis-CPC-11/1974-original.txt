was suggested to him by the Broch of Cleik-him-in (now usually written Clickemin), near Lerwick;
and in describing it he says: "The interior gallery, with its apertures, is so extremely low
and narrow, being only about three feet square, that it is difficult to conceive how it could
serve the purpose of communication. At any rate, the size fully justifies the tradition prevalent
here, as well as in the south of Scotland, that the Picts were a diminutive race."
