For every organism there is always a possibility of death. Never in history has there lived an organism which never had a possibility for death. Monerons are no exceptions. According to Christian belief, Divinity is the originator of all life forms, he who lives forever.

Stalwarts like Darwin or Heckel never came with such a nonsense thought either; nor did they ever mention that life-germs always live. So no, monerons are not life germs that can live for an inifinite term.
