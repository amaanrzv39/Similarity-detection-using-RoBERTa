The ideal of ' immortality' is not essentially   be wrong, but it won't hold true by physical and metaphysical concepts.Even  If it is a theosphist or non-theosophists,christian or spiritualist, or materialist or idealist  it is only a fancy. Some   think the lifespan of human arelimited to a hundered years or little more.But we must take death as a sudden transformation of darkness into a bright light.
