B. 1.--Whatever they were, they vanish from our ken utterly, these Palaeolithic savages, and
are followed, after what lapse of time we know not, by the users of polished flint weapons,
the tribes of the Neolithic period. And with them we find ourselves in touch with the existing
development of our island. For an island it already was, and with substantially the same area
and shores and physical features as we have them still. Our rivers ran in the same valleys,
our hills rose with the same contour, in those far-off days as now. And while the place of
flint in the armoury of Britain was taken first by bronze and then by iron, these changes were
made by no sudden breaks, but so gradually that it is impossible to say when one period ended
and the next began.
