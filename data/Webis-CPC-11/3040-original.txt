It is entitled to its place in this series on account
of forty admirable woodcuts by which it is illustrated; and to a place on the bookshelves of
every Naturalist, for the sake of the additional notes of Sir W. Jardine, and its present editor,
Mr. Jesse.

Messrs. Puttick and Simpson (191. Piccadilly) will sell on Tuesday and Wednesday next an exceedingly
choice Collection of Autograph Letters, comprising numerous Letters of extraordinary rarity,
selected principally from Upcott's Collection. We cannot attempt to particularise the many
interesting lots which are to be found in the present collection, but recommend the Catalogue
to attention for the satisfactory manner in which the different documents are arranged and
described.
