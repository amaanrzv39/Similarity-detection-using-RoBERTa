These dainties, as will have been seen, have a large amount of butter, and soften
in a warm room; they must therefore be made in a cold room, and if set on ice some hours before
cooking will be much easier to fry without bending or twisting.

Cigarettes à la Chasseur are, as the name indicates, made of game, in exactly the same way
as the last recipe.

Lobster Quenelles.--Prepare with bread panada as directed for quenelle meat. Poach and drain
them. Then dish in a circle with thick Hollandaise sauce in the centre and round them.

Chicken, Turtle Fashion.--This requires a pullet or young hen about six months old. Bone the
bird; stuff with a force-meat made of four parts minced veal, two parts chopped hard eggs,
a half part lean boiled ham, two parts mushrooms, and two parts pâté de foie gras.
