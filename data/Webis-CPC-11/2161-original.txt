There is no manner of advantage in being alive. The sole safety is to lie flat on the earth
along with one's generation. The moment an audacious head is lifted one inch above the general
level, pop! goes the unerring rifle of some biographical sharp-shooter, and it is all over
with the unhappy owner. A perfectly respectable and well-meaning man, suffering under the accumulated
pains of Presidentship, has the additional and entirely undeserved ignominy of being hawked
about the country as the "Pioneer Boy."
