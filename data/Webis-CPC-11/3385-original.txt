Luther's dream of restoring
religion to its primitive purity has come to but as poor realization at the hands of his so-called
followers, which leads one to think that if the martyrs of the Reformation could come back
and see the fruits of their martyrdom--suffered that pure religion might live--they would conclude
that, for all the resulting good accomplished, they might as well have kept a whole skin and
a whole set of bones.

In cases of pronounced phimosis the aperture in the prepuce may not be in a line with the meatus,
and the resulting discharge of urine or the ejaculations of seminal fluid may from this cause
be unable to find an egress. The fluid escaping from the urethra will, in case the opening
is at the side or upper part of the prepuce, cause it to balloon out until a sufficient quantity
is thrown out so as to distend, the opening as well as the prepuce, before it can find its
way out; in such cases impotency is liable to be as complete as in those cases of stricture
wherein the seminal fluid is forced backward into the bladder. Having given this general view
of the effects of phimosis as it may affect man in the shape of his organ, which may have a
serious result in his domestic relations or in becoming a father, we will proceed to the consideration
of diseases and conditions that phimosis encourages and to which it renders man more liable.
In the consideration of these cases it must not be forgotten that the sexual relations are
much more to man or woman than is generally acknowledged. The days for the establishment of
the Utopian republic of Plato are not yet with us. That Platonic love does exist is true, as
it has in the past and will in the future.
