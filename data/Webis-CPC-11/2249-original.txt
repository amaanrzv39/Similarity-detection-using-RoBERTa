Another eminent French writer whom he much wished to know was Victor Hugo, and I am told that
for years he carried about him a letter of introduction from Lord Houghton, always hoping for
an opportunity of presenting it. The hope was not fulfilled, though, in 1866, Mr. Browning
crossed to Saint Malo by the Channel Islands and spent three days in Jersey.

It was during this winter in Paris that Mr. Browning became acquainted with M. Joseph Milsand,
the second Frenchman with whom he was to be united by ties of deep friendship and affection.
