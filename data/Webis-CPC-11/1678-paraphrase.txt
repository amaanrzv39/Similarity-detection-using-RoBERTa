There were many books printed in the early years on the subjects of conjuring, lycanthropy, and werewolves.  There are also lots of books on monsters.  Claude Prieur's book of 1596, a duodecimo entitled "Dialogue de la Lycantropie ou Transformation d'hommes en Loups..." is rare but not very valuable.
