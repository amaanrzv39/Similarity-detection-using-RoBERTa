This was the
beginning of a storm which raged for days, and I still have of it a confused memory, a sort
of nightmare, in which strange horrors figure, and which to this day haunts me at intervals
when I am on the sea. The thing that stands out most strongly during that period is the white
face of my mother, ill in her berth. We were with five hundred emigrants on the lowest deck
of the ship but one, and as the storm grew wilder an unreasoning terror filled our fellow-passengers.
