And it is true, because they were not properly built.
When properly built, they preserve the most equal temperature at all seasons. They are warm
in winter and cool in summer, and the sudden changes which affect the weather without, need
scarcely be felt by the delicate invalid within the walls of the stone mansion, if suitable
attention is given to the simple matter of ventilation.

But let us return to the subject of adaptation. The illustrations which occur to us may serve
to furnish a somewhat clear idea of what we mean by the prime conditions necessary to be observed
in building.

By the term adaptation, we mean such choice of style, material, size and arrangement as shall
fit the structure: 1st, to the site; 2d, to the climate; and 3d, to the uses for which it is built.

And, first, as to the site: It would be obviously incongruous to erect the same house on these
two different sites, with their different characteristic features and surroundings; for example,
the one a nearly level plane gently rising, perhaps, as you approach from the road the position
where the house shall stand, and sloping away again towards other broad green fields and the
fertile meadows beyond--with no background of hills or mountains, no irregularly formed lake,
but with a placid, lazy stream, half-sleeping, half-gliding by the weeping elms, and among
the scattered groups of stately, old trees:--the other, a romantic hillside in the native forest,
with its neighboring mountain range, where in the bright summer-time, the noisy, laughing brook
keeps time to your thoughts and fancies as you wander among the hills, and in the bleak winter
the winds sigh mournfully through the pines or utter their clarion calls to the spirit of the
storm.
