In September 1819, John Gird had a note endorsed for $4,100 by Isaac Entwistle and mortgaged his personal possessions, which were listed as "clock, sideboard, writing desk, ditto with settee to match, sofa and secretary each one, mahogany dining table, bureaus, looking glasses, fenders and tea ditto each two, one pair card tables, one dozen rush bottom chairs, carpets, brass andirons, shovel, tongs, window curtains, three beds, chair, wash stand, chest, house linen, one set gift tea china, four waiters, one half dozen silver teaspoons, one set plated castors, sundry glass and earthen ware, kitchen furniture etc."

After six years this debt wasn't cleared up and John Gird secured the debt with his house and lot.
