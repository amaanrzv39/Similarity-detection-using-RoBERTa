Oh that amazing group of people! There is but not an art or science for which the phrase Lucretius has employed about victory over superstition "Primum Graius homo--"

I find myself to be fortunate that I am able to study the great masters while I am still in my youth and mature sense. Most people study the great thinkers till their mid twenties but then never get time for such studies till they get very old and start getting senile. As a result the ideas most people get about greek literature are the ideas they form till they reach mid twenties.
