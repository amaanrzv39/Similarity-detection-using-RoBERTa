Both times Mr. Ash competed, he came in at a close second, but despite not winning first, his venture for the Roman Scholarship Prize was high enough to win him an honorable mention.

H.L. Duhring Jr. was a close second for the University of Pennsylvania scholarship.

At the last T Square Club meeting, two sets of drawings were submitted. The program called for a "Garden for a Palatial Country House", and required the scales to be 1/8" for a house and terrace, and a 1/32" scale for the garden sections.

The problem was nearly the same as the project given at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, both of which required a vast amount of graded color wash work, to intimidate many competitors. A. C. Mu√±oz won first mention after submitting three drawings, two of them were three by four feet. Albert Kelsey was disqualified for omiting the 1/8" scale plan.

Some discussion about the postponment of the competition took place, but Kelsey would rather be disqualified than work on the project any longer; and the fact that three draughtsmen in Day's office and two in Cope & Stewardson's office had unfinished designs to complete may have influenced his decision. But dspite of the result, Mr. Kesey's eleven points gave him the highest average for the past year's work.
