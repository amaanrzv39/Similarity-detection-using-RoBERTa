See account in D. N. B. Brembre was mayor
in 1377, 1383-4-5. He was the political leader of the group of King Richard's friends in London.
Of his public career I shall not treat since that is sufficiently covered elsewhere. To illustrate
his financial dealings, the following abstracts of documents are important. In September 1377,
the King borrowed L10,000 of Brembre, Wallworth, Philipot and John Haddele (grocer, later Mayor
of London), and certain other merchants, for whom these were attorneys, pledging the crown
jewels.
