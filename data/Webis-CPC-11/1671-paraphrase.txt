The spectra of everybody known components, with the exception of a few gaseous ones, or those too rare towards be yet elicited,   possess been photographed within joint with the solar spectrum, from the excessive ultra-violet down towards the D rope, and eye  comments possess been made onto a lot towards the limit of the solar spectrum. A  list of regular wave lengths of the impurities  within the carbon poles extending towards wave length 2,000 has been constructed  towards quantity wave lengths beyond the limits of the solar spectrum.
