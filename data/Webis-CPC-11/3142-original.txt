Douglas died too soon to make clear to a passion-stirred
world that he was as warmly attached to the Union, as intensely loyal, as devotedly patriotic,
as Lincoln himself.

The grave questions arising from the War, which disturbed our politics for twenty years, the
great economic questions which have agitated us for the past fifteen years, bear slight relation
to those dark problems with which Douglas and his contemporaries grappled.  He was on the wrong
side of many struggles preliminary to the War. He was not a profound student of political economy,
hence is not an authority for any party in the perplexing questions of recent times.  The result
is that the greatest political leader of the most momentous decade of our history is less known
to us than any second-rate hero of the Revolution.
