The grannam, or green-tail-fly, with a wing like a
moth, comes on generally morning and evening, from five till eight o'clock, A.M. in mild weather,
in the end of March and through April. Then there are the blue and the brown, both ephemerae,
which come on, the first in dark days, the second in bright days; these flies, when well imitated,
are very destructive to fish. The first is a small fly, with a palish yellow body, and slender,
beautiful wings, which rest on the back as it floats down the water. The second, called the
cob in Wales, is three or four times as large, and has brown wings, which likewise protrude
from the back, and its wings are shaded like those of a partridge, brown and yellow brown.
