It is due to Mr. Idle to relate that his mind sauntered towards this peculiar conclusion on
distinct and logically-producible grounds.  After reviewing, quite at his ease, and with many
needful intervals of repose, the generally-placid spectacle of his past existence, he arrived
at the discovery that all the great disasters which had tried his patience and equanimity in
early life, had been caused by his having allowed himself to be deluded into imitating some
pernicious example of activity and industry that had been set him by others.  The trials to
which he here alludes were three in number, and may be thus reckoned up:  First, the disaster
of being an unpopular and a thrashed boy at school; secondly, the disaster of falling seriously
ill; thirdly, the disaster of becoming acquainted with a great bore.
