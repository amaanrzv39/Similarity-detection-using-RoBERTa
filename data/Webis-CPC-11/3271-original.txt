They were not the surgeons of Naples who essayed to galvanize volition through my paralyzed
limbs, but those who knew the utmost resources of their art. And so I lived,--lived, too, by
reason of my inextinguishable vitality, by reason of this spark that will not quench,--and
so I came to Hellberg. It would have been mockery to give this shapeless hulk to sentence,
and then to headsman or hangman; perhaps, too, her haughty name had been involved; and so I
was never brought to trial, and so I am at Hellberg.

And I have never set foot on the ground again. But, oh, to touch it for a moment, to sit anywhere
on the summer mould, to pull down the sun-quivering, sun-steeped branches about me, to scent
the fresh grass as it springs to the light! Oh. but to touch the sweet, kind earth, the warm
earth, silent with ineffable tenderness and soothing, to feel it under my hand, to lay my cheek
there for a moment, while it drew away pain and weariness with its absorbing, purifying power!
Oh, but to lie once more where the blossoms grow! Soon, soon, they will grow above me! Soon
the kind mother will cover me!

What had happened in the outer world I knew not till you came. I fancied Lenore returned, breathing
Austrian air, and living under the same horizon that girds me in. Sometimes I have seen a distant
cavalcade skimming over the vale, as once we careered over the Campagna, when she handled her
steed as another woman handles her needle, and the sweet wind fanned peach-tints to her cheeks
and drew out unravelled braids of gold in lingering caress.
