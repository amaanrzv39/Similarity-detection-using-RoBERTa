Stop right there. We don't want to rember what happened because it was heavy, but now it's gone. 

It is gone, I thought as I wept internally, but I should have said this. Gods above, look at these people and bless them because you brought us together. 

Amen, Gonzallo. 

He is gone. Was Millanie made King of Napals because of what he said? We should rejoice and remeber this for forever.  Claribell found her husband Tunis when she only looked once. Her brother even found a wife when he could not find his way home and Prospero became a duke on a poor island. We all found ourselves, even though none of us actually belong to ourselves.
