It is not necessary to trace the place through all its possessors.
In the reign of Henry VIII. it was the property of Thomas Howard, the first Duke of Norfolk.
On the attainder of his son, the castle escheated to the crown. Shortly afterwards it was granted
to Sir John Byron for fifty years. In the reign of James I., Gilbert Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury,
was the owner of Bolsover. In the year 1613, he sold it to Sir Charles Cavendish, whose eldest
son William, was the first Duke of Newcastle, a personage of great eminence among the nobility
of his time, and in high favour at court.[1] He was sincerely attached to his royal master,
Charles I., whom he entertained at Bolsover Castle, on three different occasions, in a style
of princely magnificence.
