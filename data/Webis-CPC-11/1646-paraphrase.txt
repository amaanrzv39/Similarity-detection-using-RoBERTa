Imagine, for a moment, that there has been an epoch of elevation: Vast mountain chains have climbed skyward, volcanoes have spewed forth their lava, and fault-scarped cliffs run across the landscape. Now, imagine that, for a brief period of time, the forces of elevation cease their growth. The mountains will begin to get worn down little by little until a peneplain, as W.M. Davis has termed it, is achieved. This specific type of plain is similar in nature to that of a hyperbola approaching its asymptote.
