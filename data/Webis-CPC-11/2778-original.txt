It was one of those wooden soldiers whose arms and legs are to go by means
of a string; but the string, you know, is always getting hitched. This was the case now, and
it tasked all Alick's wonderful brains to set it right. How my back and arm did ache as I held
it up for him, lying flat on the grass, to twitch, and pull, and contrive, and, at last, to
conquer! That happy moment had just come when there was a sound of wheels in the road near
us. One minute more, and Uncle Hugh's voice was heard calling us, and the carriage stopped
to take us up. What grand, glorious news we were told as we drove home, two hatless, jacketless,
sun-burnt children, I must not tell you this time.
