The home of birds are seperated from the the stony matter with a tip ending in a small iron instrument with thin flexible blade.  A wax candle is kept farthest from it and the same is placed with guano of many feet fence and are picked up in bags.  The white nests are collected three times in an year with a gap of one month and the black nests pick up only two times in a year.

It is interesting that each den especially the big ones with natural markings, is seemed to be the asset of certain persons which hold it during the period of their birth to death and hand over the same to the inheritors.
