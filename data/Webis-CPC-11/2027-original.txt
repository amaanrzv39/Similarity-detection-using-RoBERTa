The
executants are five in number; one plays the tambourine, Mr. Germon, who is the leader; another
the bone castanet; the third, the accordion; and the two others, the banjo, or African guitar.
The castanet player does not sing; but his four colleagues have good voices, and, in glees,
harmonize charmingly.  In a quartet, the parody on the Phantom Chorus, from Bellini’s ‘Sonnambula’;
and in a glee, ‘You’ll See Them on the Ohio,’ nothing can be more effective than the skilful
blending of the parts.
