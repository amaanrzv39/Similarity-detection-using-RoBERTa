You should consider the vast amount of land available not only in Alleghania, but also in Texas.  Texas is large enough and well-manned enough to produce six times as much cotton as the South currently produces.  It is argued, therefore, that there be grants provided to settlers, and railroads constructed, in order to offset secession.  This should be considered particularly in light of the heavy costs of the war.
