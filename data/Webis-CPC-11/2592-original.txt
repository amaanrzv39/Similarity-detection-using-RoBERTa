It was 27 feet high,
and weighed about 40 tons, being made of brass guns taken by the Duke in various victories.
Being of so great a weight, the appliances to remove it were on an equally massive scale, the
carriage and framework in which it was placed weighing about 20 tons.  It took 100 soldiers
to haul the statue out of the studio; and, when mounted on its carriage, it took 29 huge dray
horses, lent by Mr. Goding, of the Lion Brewery, Waterloo, to drag it to its destination. 
It was escorted by soldiers and military bands, and did the distance in about an hour a half.
The next day was spent in preparing to hoist it; the day after, it was lifted some 50 feet,
and there remained all nightâ€”and the next day was safely landed and put in position.
