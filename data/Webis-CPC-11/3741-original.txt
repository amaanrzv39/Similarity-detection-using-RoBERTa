The factor of a divine intelligence he sets aside as of no consequence. And Mr. Haeckel would
have us believe that a few "monistic materialists" are the only men entitled to a hearing upon
the question of "Evolution." So he excludes all true and intelligent Christians, for they are
not and can not be "monistic materialists." But just what the man means by the "highest moment"
we are anxious to know, as he is the most blank negative of religion that we can conceive.
When he attempts to answer the religious objections to evolution, or, as he terms it, the descendence
theory, he unceremoniously dismisses them as beneath his notice, giving his only argument,
viz.: "All faith is superstition." He disposes of the objections drawn from first, or intuitive
truths, by a simple denial of their existence, asserting that all our knowledge is from our
senses. Others, again, are specialists." He says "It is not enough that a man should be versed
in one department, he must be at home in all, in Botany, Zoology, Comparative Anatomy, Biology,
Geology and Paleontology. He must be able to survey the whole field." (See Philosophie and
Empirie, pp. 638-641.)

This statement alone should stir up all Deists to a consideration of their teaching touching
the sufficiency of the "Book of Nature;" for if it be true, then we must expect some other
revelation, or be left to the conclusion that the Great Father has left his creatures in a
great measure in a state of helplessness, unless Mr. Haeckel, or some other man like himself,
can show us that the "Great Spirit" intended that he, and others like him, should do our thinking
for us, seeing that we are incapable through mental deficiency, of raising the edifice, and
seeing that, Mr. Huxley advises us poor (?) theologians to "let it alone."
