    Oh, go not yet, my godlike love, stay but a moment more
    And Zenia's step shall lead thee on, to Hayna's golden shore,
    No white man's foot has ever trod, the vale that slumbers there,
    Or forced the gold bird from its nest, or Gato from his lair;
    But cradled round by giant hills, lies many a golden mine,
    And all the treasure they contain, shall be my Diez thine,
    And all my tribe will be thy friends, our warrior chief thy guard,
    With Zenia's breast thy faithful shield, thy love her sweet reward.
