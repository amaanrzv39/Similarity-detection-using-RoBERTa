The first occurrence was a somewhat prolonged engagement between a division of fifteen gunboats
and the frigate "Junon," which, having been sent to destroy vessels at the mouth of the James
River, was caught becalmed and alone in the upper part of Hampton Roads; no other British vessel
being nearer than three miles. The cannonade continued for three quarters of an hour, when
a breeze springing up brought two of her consorts to the "Junon's" aid.
