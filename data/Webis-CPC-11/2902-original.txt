But the point was to plant them in New England, where they might grow, but would never stay.
One of the first letters which I received after taking charge of the Department over which
I preside was an extremely well-written one from a western State, asking for a Consulate, and
beginning in this wise: "I have no excuse for intruding on your busy occupations except a pardonable
desire to live elsewhere." [Laughter.] Now that has been the mainspring of New Englanders ever
since they were seated by Providence on its barren shores, a pardonable desire to live elsewhere.
[Laughter.] If they had been planted here--if they had been seated in the luxurious climate
and with the fertile soil of the South, they would have had no desire, pardonable or otherwise,
to live elsewhere.
