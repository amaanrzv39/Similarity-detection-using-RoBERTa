It was one of the most remarkable things about Jasmin, that he was never carried off his feet
by the brilliant ovations he received. Though enough to turn any poor fellow's head, he remained
simple and natural to the last. As we say in this country, he could "carry corn" We have said
that "Gascon" is often used in connection with boasting or gasconading. But the term was in
no way applicable to Jasmin. He left the echo of praises behind him, and returned to Agen to
enjoy the comforts of his fireside.
