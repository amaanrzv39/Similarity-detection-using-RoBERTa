I consider him vouched for as authority, therefore, by men in whom you can put
confidence. Dr. COLLINS makes the following statement:--

When his predecessor, Dr. JOSEPH CLARKE, was in office, in the year 1784, he found that seventeen
children in the hundred, nearly one in six, died within the first fortnight after birth, nineteen-twentieths
of these of one particular disease peculiar to very early infancy. Looking for the cause of
this frightful mortality, he thought he found it in a foul and vitiated state of the air of
the hospital.
