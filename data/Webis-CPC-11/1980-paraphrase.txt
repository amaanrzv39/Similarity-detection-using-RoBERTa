Well, your egregious spending on reconstructing the church didn't cost me a darn thing, so what right do I have to complain? I hope you're happy with the results! Isn't that what really matters, here? You and your precious Results! Oh, well . . . fools and their money . . . blah, blah. You wouldn't listen to some old tired saying coming from some old ignorant fusspot who was here to appreciate the church in its original condition. Things were JUST FINE before you came in and ruined things with your completely unnecessary work! But, oh, no, I can't be rude. I must not be rude. Can't be rude. Oh, no! You got the results you wanted and that's all that matters because my mind is MADE UP and my opinion is going to stay the same as it always was!
