The dinner had passed off without any remarkable occurrence,
and considering the ominous quantity of Champagne consumed (a very favourite beverage on all
gala days with the middle classes of society at St. Petersburgh), I found the party almost
philosophical. Toasts to the bride and bridegroom had been repeatedly drunk, and the night
was far advanced when the passajonaiatetz took the bride by the hand, and conducted her into
the bed-chamber, where he consigned her to the care of all the married ladies present, himself
retiring immediately after. Those matrons assisted in disrobing her of the bridal vestments,
and in assuming the garb appropriate to the chamber in which they were. The passajonaiatetz
next performed the like office of conducting the bridegroom to the chamber, who put on his
schlafrock, or nightgown, the married ladies having previously retired. These operations being
concluded, the doors of the bed-chamber were thrown open, and we all walked in in procession,
quaffing a goblet of Champagne to the health of the parties, kissing the bride's hands, who
returned the salutations on our cheeks, and embracing Ã  la Francaise the cheeks of the bridegroom,
who luckily, in the present instance, had neither the Russian beard nor the modern English
whiskers. With one voice we then wished the happy pair a hearty blessing, and withdrew, when
the doors were closed. The company gradually dispersed. Dinners and dancing went on for three
successive days.
