Both these signs, I had been told, meant that I was relatively approaching the town; so I took a short cut up across the forest  again a stimulus of hill--a short cut most legitimate, because it was trodden and very manifestly used--and I sauntered up and  otherwise onto a grade for a mile, along a lane of the woods and beneath low, dripping trees. When this short silence of the forest was again,  I observed an excellent sight.

There, beneath me, whereas the lane began towards dip, was the former of the German cities.
