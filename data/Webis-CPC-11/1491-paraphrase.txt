The tomb of Edward I bears an inscription, which reads:

Edward I is buried here, ruler and overseer of the Scots for forty-six years.

Edward III's tomb, which is made out of copper, also has this inscription:

Of all the English kings, here is buried one of the best.  Edward the III was a generous king, a preserver of peace.

Next to the tomb, another inscription reads:

Edward III has become known in all the earth and heavens.
