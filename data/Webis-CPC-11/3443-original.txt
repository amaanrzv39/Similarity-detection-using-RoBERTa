Just imagine
one of these conditioned females and one of the mouse-headed, corona-deficient, long-pointed
glans males in the act of copulation! The conical penis finds its way in the reflected fold
of the vagina, while the point of the uterus may be two or three inches in some other direction,
making impregnation wholly impossible; besides, in the normal-shaped penis, the corona acting
as a valve, behind which the circular muscular fibres of the vagina close themselves, tends
to retain the seminal fluid in front, while the very shape of the organ assists in straightening
out the vaginal canal and to bring the uterus in proper position. In the long, thin, narrow
and pointed glans, devoid of corona, there is no mechanical means to retain the seminal discharge.
Some years ago some one introduced the idea of postural copulation, to be tried in cases of
sterility, and it has been found that impregnation would take place in some cases where it
had formerly appeared impossible, this position having the effect of righting malpositions
during the act, which were the cause of the sterility; but it stands to reason that, where
the shape of the organ is such that it further favors malpositions, as well as where it offers
no obstacle to the vagina immediately expressing or dropping out all the seminal fluid, impregnation
is more difficult, and that, where the uterine deformity is coincident with this condition
of penis to assist, it becomes well nigh impossible.
