The practice of throwing a
    tub or barrel to a large fish, to divert the animal from gambols
    dangerous to a vessel, is also mentioned in an old prose translation of
    the Ship of Fools. These passages satisfactorily explain the common
    phrase of throwing a tub to a whale."

Sir James Macintosh conjectures that the phrase "the tale of a tub" (which was familiarly known
in Sir Thomas More's time) had reference to the tub thrown to the whale.
