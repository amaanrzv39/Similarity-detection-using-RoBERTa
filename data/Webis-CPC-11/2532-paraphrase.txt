Consider a park, without healthy trees it cannot look beautiful, and healthy trees require the correct climate, and sufficient nutrition. Trees and shrubs which require constant cutting to maintain a reasonable appearance will cost too much in maintenance to use in a park and other plants should be chosen by the park designer when designing an economical, natural park.

Good practise in park construction will lead to parks in cities becoming less artificial, leading to reduced maintenance costs.
