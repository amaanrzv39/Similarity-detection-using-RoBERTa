There were fourteen fathoms under us to starboard.
The little sail soon gave way at the top and fell into the water.

One anchor was sent out in a boat and then another, and when they tried to get up the first
it was so entangled that they were a long time over it, and one of the five flukes was broken.
We were kept off the reef by poles all this time. That broken anchor was then taken ashore,
and we were very thankful to be safe.

The flat ground for miles inland is composed of nothing but madrepore, and is covered with
semi-fossilised sea-shells, which have probably not been inhabited for thousands of years.
We walked over this for three miles before reaching the first spurs of the mountains, and it
is impossible to conceive a more barren or arid spot.
