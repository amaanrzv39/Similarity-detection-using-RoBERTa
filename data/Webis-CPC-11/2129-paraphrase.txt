It was raining cats and dogs. He stared through the raindrops to look at the small cabins in the dreary busted up fields. Marie Louise's house was closest, and he walked towards it.

Marie Louise was a good Negress, a large woman, her hair tied back with a red kerchief, and she saw him coming from the living room window. She opened the door before he had a chance to knock. When he came into the house, he saw Fanny sitting on a chair in front of the fire, holding her soaking wet feet close to the fire to get them dry. He was relieved to find she was safe, warm and dry inside Marie Louise's house.
