Henry's rule over London was a terrible one, but nothing compared to the Catholic capitals of Rome, who veiwed the fall of the country and the murderers of St. Bartholomew. All of Henry's wrongful deeds could never add up to the heinous acts and desecration that took place in Rome in 1527 the month of May. Similar events took place in Paris in August of the same year. England was more fortunate and was spared such indecentcies under the rule of the great Tudor.
