There are many varieties of the Eagle--as the Russian and Prussian, (which, singularly enough,
have two heads,) the bald Eagle, the Osprey or Sea Eagle, the Golden Eagle, &c. The Golden
species was formerly quite common in the United States, but has now almost entirely disappeared.
Of the smaller species of the genus Falco, it is only necessary to say that, like the Eagle,
they are inedible. In other words, though excellent for hawking, they are too tough for spitting.
