91. London, 1790-92.

Matthias Flach-Franconitz, better known as Flacius Illyricus, from the place of his birth (in
Istria, a part of Illyria) was a voluminous writer on most of the controverted doctrines in
the sixteenth century. Having become a disciple of Luther he was for ever raising fresh disputes
on religious subjects, and was noted for the violence and exaggeration he brought into their
discussion, so that, according to a German historian, "he seemed to have been created for an
ecclesiastical Procurator General." On his death in 1575, Jacques Andreas, one of his friends,
admitted that, taken altogether, his Illyricus was the devil's Illyricus, and that, in the
opinion of Andreas, he was then "supping with devils."*
