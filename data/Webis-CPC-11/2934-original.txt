Treatment.--When we have to deal with a bruise, the affected part should be bathed with hot
water two or three times daily. In recent cases no other treatment will be required, but if
the swelling is not recent and has become hard or indurated, then the swollen part should be
treated each day by painting it with tincture of iodin. In snake bite a straight incision penetrating
into the flesh or muscle should be made across the center of the swelling and in the direction
of the long axis of the face. After this has been done a small wad of cotton batting should
be pressed against the wounds until the bleeding has almost stopped. Afterwards the following
lotion may be applied to the wounds several times a day: Permanganate of potassium, half a
dram; distilled water, 1 pint.
