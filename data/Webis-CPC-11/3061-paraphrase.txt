The Princess Alice paid the price for taking care of her family members who were sick from diphtheria.  In her last breath, all she could think about were the town people who were poor and some sick.  And prior to her death she told Sir William Jenner that she was sorry to cause her mother so much grief.  Her mother the Queen later thanked the towns people for their condolences at the loss of her daughter.  "She was very devoted to her duty and would give the coat off her back to those in need."

March 10, 1863 saw the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Princess Alexandria of Denmark, but eight years later he died just as his father had, suffering greatly, the date December 14, 1871.
