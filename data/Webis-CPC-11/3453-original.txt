"Well, it's consid'able ways," says the man, smiling.

"Then we must take a hack," says the pleasurer to his party. "Come on."

"I've got a hack," observes the man, in a casual way, as if the fact might possibly interest.

"O, you have, have you? Well, then, put us into it, and drive to Liverpool Wharf; and hurry."

Either the distance was less than the hackman fancied, or else he drove thither with unheard-of
speed, for two minutes later he set them down on Liverpool Wharf. But swiftly as they had come
the steamer had been even more prompt, and she now turned toward them a beautiful wake, as
she pushed farther and farther out into the harbor.

The hackman took his two dollars for his four passengers, and was rapidly mounting his box,--probably
to avoid idle reproaches. "Wait!" said the chief pleasurer. Then, "When does the next boat
leave?" he asked of the agent, who had emerged with a compassionate face from the waiting-rooms
on the wharf.

"At half past two."

"And it's now five minutes past nine," moaned the merrymakers.

"Why, I'll tell you what you can do," said the agent; "you can go to Hingham by the Old Colony
cars, and so come back by the Hull and Hingham boat."

"That's it!" chorused his listeners, "we'll go;" and "Now," said their spokesman to the driver,
"I dare say you didn't know that Liverpool Wharf was so near; but I don't think you've earned
your money, and you ought to take us on to the Old Colony Depot for half-fares at the most."
