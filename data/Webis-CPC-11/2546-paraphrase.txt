Surely there can be no doubts that, solely as a matter of conjecture, such a school wouble a winner. If in one of our large towns, an academy should be opened by some one having requisite knowledge, embodying the principle of our present offices, taking young girls and training them gratuitously, some for cooks, waiters, nursery maids, laundresses, as well as a larger number for what is termed 'general housework,' it being understood that in selecting the material the owner had an eye to truth and intelligence, it would be an immense gain. The servants graduating from such an academy would be eagerly sought for, and would command the highest salary.
