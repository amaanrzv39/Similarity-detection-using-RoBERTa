Immense applause, during which the Hon. Gentleman picks
    up a Cornet and plays a solo. Enthusiasm.

Mr. Farmer-Atkinson (bowing after recovering from his exertions). Ladies and Gentlemen. (Hear,
hear!) Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen, for your cordial reception. (Applause.) And you must
know, Ladies and Gentlemen, that although I have given you a solo on the cornet, I did not
visit this flourishing town (cheers), this highly civilised town (renewed applause), this model
town (hearty cheering), with the intention of blowing my own trumpet. (He pauses--silence.)
Don't you understand? I did not want to blow my own trumpet--joke, see? (A laugh.) Thank you!
And now about the Irish Question. Well everybody harps upon it. So will I. "Come back to Erin."
