For common crack candies, the sugar can be kept from graining by adding a teaspoonful of vinegar
or cream of tartar.

Colorings for candies should be harmless, and those used for fruit and confectionery, on page

Essences and extracts should be bought at the druggist's, not the poor kind usually sold at
the grocer's.

FRENCH CREAM CANDY.

Put four cupfuls of white sugar and one cupful of water into a bright tin pan on the range
and let it boil without stirring for ten minutes.
