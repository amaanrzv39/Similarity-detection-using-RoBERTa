His hair
was perhaps a thought longer than we encourage to-day, but one always sees odd people in the
National Gallery, where artists--most careless of men--are now constant visitors, drawn there
by the many new pictures, and especially, perhaps, the modern French examples from Sir HUGH
LANE'S collection. His hair was the more noticeable because he carried his hat in his hand;
his clothes were noticeable too, being a shade too fanciful for London in winter--but then,
who cares how people dress in London? I am sure I don't; and especially so when they have such
eyes as this boy's, dark and rich, and such a curve to such lips.

There he stood, perfectly still, his steady gaze fixed on the lady opposite, while she in her
turn never wavered in her gaze upon him.
