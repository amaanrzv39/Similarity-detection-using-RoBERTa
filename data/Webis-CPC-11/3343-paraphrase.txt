While praying for our rulers, as we have been taught, we cannot be rebellious. Who is blind and cannot see the Scriptures will control our citizens with more benefaction than any other book or any other maxims or set of opinions. Whenever the Christian Scriptures are duly regarded and their divine originality respected designing, challenging, depraving, and aspiring politicians will have but little power to plunge us into crimes and sufferings.


Marriage is the most important of all our initiations. Of all other relations, it is the paternal source. There is no exhibition of the divine goodness in conditioning our race that is more significant and lovely. This is the way our world is a collection of families in which the tendere st affections re cherished and the worst generally subdued. Here there is a community of interests. We experience the highest motives to a pure influence, especially in forming the character of the youth of our country. The race is continually multiplying and getting larger. With the appointment of the marriage relationship, what wonderful wisdom was it that consulted its honor, its virtue and eternal destiny. This was the best method which human society could be organized. There are narrow-hearted, lustful bigots who would do away with the social family compact. They talk about the "free thinking, "free love," no restraints of law, no protection of the mother save the voluntary.
