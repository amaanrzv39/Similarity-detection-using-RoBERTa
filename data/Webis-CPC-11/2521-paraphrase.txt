In regards to her writing, Mme. de Genlis' pungent tongue lost its sting. Idealized as Athenais, in the same titled novel, which for its background has the beauties of Coppet, and regenerates much of its life tenuously. The discriminations of the pious and severe Mme. Swetchine against her were so strong that for a long time, she didn't wish to see her, and admits herself at once a prisoner to her "penetrating and indefinable charm." Though for her an escape from the grip of malice wasn't always possible, there is no tribute that could be offered better to the graces of her character than the euphoria that caused her being judged severely regarding her own sex.

But she suffered her set depressed days.
