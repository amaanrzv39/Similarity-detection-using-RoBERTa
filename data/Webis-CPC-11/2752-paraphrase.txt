The conquest of Ismail was one of the most brilliant achievements that was made in Suwarrow. The conquest of Ismail actually stood out from the other two sieges. It was considered impregnable. The Empress demanded that it should be taken to be yielded. The head of the russian army, who was known as Potemkin, was displeased with Catharine's choice. Although Potemkin knew of the risk he would be taking, he was confident of success. He believed that he should follow the rule of Catherine, quoting that "The Empress wills it- we must obey!"

The march was then forced and it took four days to arrive at Ismail.
