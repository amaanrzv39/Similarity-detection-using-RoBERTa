Can something be fixed using the same broken parts?  The Mendelssohnian rule of "getting over the ground" (des flotten Daruberhinweggehens) or the ideology of just getting by, became the norm by which conductors led, rather than the exception, in that some more disciplined conductors were scoffed at for demanding a higher level performance.  

Tempo can often be a indicator as to the character and dedication of the conductor, whether or not he has befriended this rule and settles for less than perfection.

The first thing conductors should remember:  Slow means slow, brisk means brisk.
