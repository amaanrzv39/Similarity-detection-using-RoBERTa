Whatever comments, positive or otherwise, may pass on the verse of Miss Mary F.Robinson; but it is not a successful biography of Emily Bronte. The book, which appeared in series in a magazine Eminent Women laid stress on the fact that Emily and also Charlotte were among the great writers of her day. The book does not give any new information about Emily Bronte. The book is mainly devoted to shortcomings of Branwell, about whom the book adds no new information.  

Mr. Leyland has written a biography of Branwell, which contains valuable facts about Branwell. Had the book been written with greater enthusiasm, it would have been a great success. In the absence of this quality, the books seems to be quite dull and liked by only the fans of Bronte.
