The classic "preying upon the damask cheek" of grief, and the carking effect of the Black Care
that rides behind the horseman, have a perfectly similar physical mechanism. While the primary
disturbance of the banking balances of the body is less, this is continued over weeks and months,
and in addition introduces another factor hardly less potent, by interfering with all the healthful,
normal, regular habits of the body,--appetite, meal-times, sleep, recreation.
