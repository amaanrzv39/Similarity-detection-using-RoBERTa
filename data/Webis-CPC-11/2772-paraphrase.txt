You may recall from previous chapters that Adelaide broke her back trying to jump a fence while riding her Irish mare 'Molly Asthore'.  But you probably don't realize why she attempted that fateful jump.  Her husband, Welter, Lord of Ascot, conspired with a cohort to startle the mare and cause her to bolt, and in the a panicked state, throw Adelaide to the ground and kill her.  When she survived the fall, Welter flew into a rage.  Mad as a hornet and and mean as a bear stormed off home and got drunk on wine, yes, twenty-four pints of wine.
