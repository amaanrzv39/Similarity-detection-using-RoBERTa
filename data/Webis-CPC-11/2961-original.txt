This is true observation, not the
"look and say" of the oral lesson, which has no purpose in it, and leads to no natural activity,

It is difficult to satisfy the interest in animals. In connection with the Nursery School the
most suitable have been mentioned. The transition and junior school children may see others
when they go for excursions. At this stage, too, children have a great desire to learn about
wild animals, and the need often arises out of their literature: the camel that brought Rebecca
to Isaac, the wolf that adopted Mowgli, the reindeer that carried Kay and Gerda, the fox that
tried to eat the seven little kids, Androcles' lion, and Black Sambo's tiger, might form an
interesting series, helped by pictures of the creature in its own home.
