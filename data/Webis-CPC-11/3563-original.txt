And the young
lady's voice and flashing eyes showed that she was in earnest.

Our promenade lasted until the return of the Colonel, who presently took a private opportunity
of informing me that the wounded slave would probably survive, and that he had sent for a surgeon
from an adjoining plantation, expressing some apprehension that delay or indifference on his
part might involve fatal consequences.

'It's Christmas time, you see, and perhaps he won't care about coming,' said my host. I may
add that his anticipation was in part verified by the result, 'the doctor' not appearing till
the following morning. Thanks, however, to a rough knowledge of surgery on the part of the
overseer, aided by the excellence of his constitution, 'Timberlake' recovered. I will mention
here, in dismissing the subject, that 'Hurry's John' was subsequently sold to a Louisiana sugar-planter,
a fate only less terrible to a negro than his exportation to Texas.

Within an hour of our return to the house, we partook of an excellent and luxurious Christmas
dinner, to which birds of the air, beasts of the earth, and fish of the sea had afforded tribute,
and the best of European wines served as an appropriate accompaniment. The meal was, I think,
served earlier than usual, that we might attend the event of the day, the negro weddings.

These were solemnized at a little private church, in the rear of which was absolutely the most
enormous live-oak I had ever seen, its branches, fringed with pendent moss, literally covering
the small churchyard, where, perhaps, a dozen of the ---- family lie buried--a few tombstones,
half hidden by the refuse of the luxuriant vegetation, marking their places of sepulture.
