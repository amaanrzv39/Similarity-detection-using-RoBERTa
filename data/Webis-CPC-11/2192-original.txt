Rhyme, and the connexion which
it forms, have nothing in them inconsistent with the essence of dramatic dialogue, and the
objection to change of measure in the drama rests merely on a chilling idea of regularity.

No suitable versification for Comedy has yet been invented in Italy. The verso sciolto, it
is well known, does not answer; it is not sufficiently familiar. The verse of twelve syllables,
with a sdrucciolo termination selected by Ariosto, is much better, resembling the trimeter
of the ancients, but is still somewhat monotonous.
