At length, after a toilsome walk along the rough surface of the d√©bris, we reached the place
whence this wonderful flood had burst. We found on each side of the valley a huge lump of the
embankment remaining, while a vast gulf yawned between. This was somewhat different from what
we expected; for we had seen it stated in the newspapers, that the whole was swept away. So
far from this being the case, fully half of the entire mass remains, including portions of
that central depression which has been spoken of. There is more importance in remarking this
fact than may at first sight appear. In the investigation of the mysterious subject of the
Parallel Roads of Glenroy, one theory has been extensively embraced--that they were produced
by a lake, which has since burst its bounds and been discharged. It has been asked: Where was
the dam that retained this lake? and should we not expect, if there was any such dam, that
it could not be wholly swept away? Would not fragments of it be found at the sides of the valley--the
breaking down of the centre being sufficient to allow the waters to pass out? When we look
at the masses left on each side of the Bilberry embankment, we see the force and pertinence
of these queries, and must admit that the lake theory is so far weakened. In the bottom of
the breach, a tiny rill is now seen making its exit--the same stream which cumulatively took
so formidable a shape a few months ago. For a mile up the valley, we see traces of the ground
having been submerged.
