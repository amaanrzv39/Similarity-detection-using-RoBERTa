There are other broader reasons why England and France are antagonistic towards each other. It is questionable whether or not these states will force other satellite states to do their will as they tried to do in Texas in 1844, or if the government will triumph over the rebel states and coax them back into the Union. This would have the effect of establishing our power again, especially in light of our monopoly of cotton. It is easy to understand why England and France are manipulating as they are, but the issue at hand affects us much more strongly than it does them.

It is not only a question of goodwill towards the freed African Americans of the South, nor is it a question of how rich and powerful we are. Other dilemmas are much more important, and they deal with the rights and interests of the citizens still in the Union, in particular, the population of laboring white men throughout the country.
