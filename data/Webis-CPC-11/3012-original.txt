The traditional explanation
for the devil’s broken leg is his fall from heaven. “I beheld Satan as lightning fall from
heaven” (Luke x, 18). All rebellious deities, who were universally supposed to have fallen
from heaven, have crooked or crippled legs. Hephaestos, Vulcan, Loki and Wieland, each has
a broken leg. This idea has probably been derived from the crooked lightning flashes. The devil’s
mother in the mediaeval German mystery-plays walks on crutches. Asmodeus, the Persian demon
Aeshma daeva, also had a lame foot. In Le Sage’s book Le Diable boiteux Asmodeus appears as
a limping gentleman, who uses two sticks as crutches. According to rabbinical tradition this
demon broke his leg when he hurried to meet King Solomon.
