(as Mrs. BROWNING says) my eulogy of that man
of "Phoenician stamp," the "universal ODYSSEUS," who expressed the many-sided, the all-accomplished
man; the polutropos, the polumetis, the tlemon, the polutlas, the polumekanos, the poikilometis,
the poluphron, the da√Øphron, the talasiphron. (What a peck of p's!) In battle never foiled!
In council supreme! His oratory like the snow-flakes of the winter storm. Superbly representative
Phoenician! "But over and above this universality of ODYSSEUS in the arts of life, he bears
the Phoenician stamp in what may be termed his craft." Aha! The "Old Parliamentary Hand" of
his period plainly. Wonder if MAX thought of that! Hellas and Phoenicia combined! As a Statesman
of classical culture, commercial instincts and craft, what a shining success ODYSSEUS might
have been in these days!

  He went into the Cyclops' cave
    To see what he could spy out;
  He slew his oxen, stole his sheep,
    And then he poked his eye out,

as the ribald doggerelist has it. Sounds a little "predatory," perhaps, as SALISBURY would
say. But quite capable of being "spiritualised" into a sound Liberal policy, directed against
the purblind Poluphemos of Property and Privilege.

On the whole, I had a high old time among the Orientalists. But when discussion ensued, I longed
to throw off my disguise and rush, Achilles-like, into the fray. But MAX might have thought
that inconsistent with my "colossal humanity;" so, very unwillingly, I refrained.
