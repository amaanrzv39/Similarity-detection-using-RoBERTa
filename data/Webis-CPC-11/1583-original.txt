I called it Lily, because it was so
     white. I got it when it was a little bit of a thing, and I did not
     keep it in a cage. I taught it to eat out of my hand, and when I
     came from school and called Lily, it would come flying from the
     barn-yard, where it was with the other pigeons, and light on my
     shoulder, and put its bill up to my mouth. One day I called Lily,
     and it did not come. I went to look for it in the barn-yard myself.
