For this purpose they make two
holes in the ice, about eight inches in diameter, and six feet asunder, in a direction from
north to south. The northern hole they screen from the sun by a bank of snow about four feet
in height, raised in a semi-circle round its southern edge, and form another similar bank on
the north side of the southern hole, sloped in such a manner as to reflect the rays of the
sun into it. The Esquimaux then lies down, with his face close to the northern aperture, beneath
which the water is strongly illuminated by the sunbeams entering at the southern. In his left
hand he holds a red string, with which he plays in the water to allure the fish, and in his
right, a spear ready to strike them as they approach; and in this manner, they soon take as
many as they want.
