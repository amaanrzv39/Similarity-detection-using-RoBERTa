What advantage would accrue to shareholders? Would England, in case of forcible annexation,
not be under the necessity of incurring a heavy charge in the increase of her South African
garrisons, and so be justified in levying a considerable royalty upon the output, which would
materially reduce the dividends? What advantage would arise to England by substituting an unproductive
and costly war in South Africa for conditions of peace and prosperity, which alone can yield
her commerce profit? England can only derive profit from wars waged between other peoples.
And as to the incentive of commercial supremacy, England, while possessing that to a large
extent already, freely and voluntarily allows all comers from other nationalities to share
the benefits with her by her principle of free trade.
