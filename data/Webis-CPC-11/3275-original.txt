For the
Chorus-Singers were never elected by Suffrage at all, but hir’d by the proper Officer who was
at the Expence of the Chorus: and the Furnishers of the Chorus had never either Table, or Stipend,
allowed them, towards their Charge. To what Purpose then is this Sentence, which should be
a Deduction from the Premises, and yet is none, brought in? Or how comes the Reasoning to be
founded upon what was not the Fact? The Mistake manifestly arises from a careless Transposition
made in the Text: Let the two Greek Words, which I have distinguished by Capitals, only change
Places, and we recover what Platonius meant to infer: “That the [A]Furnishers of Chorus’s being
no longer elected by Suffrage, and the [B]Chorus-Singers having no Provision made for them,
Chorus’s were abolished, and the Subjects of Comedies alter’d.”

II. There is another more egregious Error still subsisting in this instructive Fragment, which
has likewise escaped the Notice of the Learned. The Author is saying, that, in the old Comedy,
the Masks were made so nearly to resemble the Persons to be satirized, that before the Actor
spoke a Word, it was known whom he was to personate. But, in the New Comedy, when Athens was
conquered by the Macedonians, and the Poets were fearful lest their Masks should be construed
to resemble any of their New Governors, they formed them so preposterously as only to move
Laughter; ὁρῶμεν γοῦν (says He) τὰς ὀφρῦς ἐν τοῖς προσώποις τῆς Μενάνδρου κωμῳδίας ὁποίας ἔχει,
καὶ ὅπως ἐξεστραμμένον τὸ ΣΩΜΑ. καὶ οὐδε κατὰ ἀνθρώπων φύσιν.
