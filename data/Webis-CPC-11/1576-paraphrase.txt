The dace does very well in some rivers where the brown trout cannot live.  For the Sussex Ouse this is incredible.  Slightly more than 10 years ago the dace was absent from that river and now there are countles dace there.  They got here because they were used as bait for pike, but they escaped and became the current stock.  The best dace thrive in sluggish and muddy rivers.
