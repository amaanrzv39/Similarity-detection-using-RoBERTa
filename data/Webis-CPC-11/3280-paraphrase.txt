Unlike  all other places of south Latitudes which I have experienced and heard of,in Bahia the wet season begins in April with violent tornados, thunder and lightning because the southern wind enters the coast. The coasting trade of east-north-east causes the dry season as the wind clears the sky.In southern latitudes the usually the dry season sets in April and the rainy season  begins in October and november. Whereas in Northern latitudes the seasons vary as Wet seasons on April and dry season begins in September. The coast of Brazil also have the same season as northern latitude. In the latter part of September the weather is fairly well and they begin to cut their sugarcane there. Formerly I was told that the Brazilians cut the cane on july.
