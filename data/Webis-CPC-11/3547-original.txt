In 1825 he commenced a careful re-examination of the numerous nebulae
and starry clusters which had been discovered by his father, and described in the "Philosophical
Transactions," fixing their positions and investigating their aspects. He devoted eight years
to this magnum opus, completing it in 1832. The catalogue which he then contributed to the
"Philosophical Transactions" includes 2306 nebulae and star-clusters, of which 525 were discovered
by himself. While engaged in this difficult task, Herschel discovered between three and four
thousand double stars, which he described in the Memoirs of the Astronomical Society. His observations
were made with an excellent Newtonian telescope, twenty feet in focal length, and eighteen
and a half inches in aperture; and having obtained, to use his own expression, "a sufficient
mastery over the instrument," the idea occurred to him of making it available for a survey
of the southern heavens. Accordingly, he left England on the 13th of November 1833, and arrived
at Cape Town on the 16th of January 1834. Five days later he wrote to his aunt as follows:--

     "Here we are safely lauded and comfortably housed at the far
     end of Africa; and having secured the landing and final storage
     of all the telescopes and other matters, as far as I can see,
     without the slightest injury, I lose no time in reporting to
     you our good success so far. M----[1] and the children are,
     thank God, quite well; though, for fear you should think her
     too good a sailor, I ought to add that she continued sea-sick,
     at intervals, during the whole passage. We were nine weeks and
     two days at sea, during which period we experienced only one
     day of contrary wind.
