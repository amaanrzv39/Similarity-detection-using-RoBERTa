The grains are taken off the pithy cylinder
on which they grow, by being rubbed or scraped on a piece of iron: in America a bayonet (a
weapon called by the Yankees Uncle George's toasting fork) is invariably used for the purpose:
the cylinder, now bared of its grain, is called the cobb. The delicate leaves by which the
ear is enveloped is, as has been mentioned, called the husk; it may be used for the stuffing
of beds: Mr. Cobbett has converted some of it even into paper.
