Our business, however, is with his English adventures, which must, I think, have astonished
him as much as anything that he met with in Arabia, even if he acted all the Thousand and One
Nights on the spot. As I have already said, he and his companion (Albrecht Friedrich Woltersdorf,
son of the Pastor of St. George's Church in Berlin), landed at Harwich on Sunday, August 10.
They staid there that night, and on Monday they walked over to Colchester.
