The indignant Pilot exclaimed, “Forty-eight hours!” and raised his voice to surmount the din.  “What are you doing with forty-eight hours’ leave in London?” he asked.
The Adjutant explained that he is not going on leave but on duty.  The Stunt Pilot laughing mockingly added bitterly a question on what duty he was going on. The Adjutant unfurling his towel, answered calmly, if he really wanted to know, he is going to there to buy a vacuum-cleaner for the Mess.  The outraged Pilot calling him an annoying old wangler, he made himself heard at last.
