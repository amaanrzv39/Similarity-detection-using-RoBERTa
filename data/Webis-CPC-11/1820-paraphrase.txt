It must be recollected, that this order was issued and executed on the last day of February, six weeks after the Charleston Gazette had announced , the ratification of the treaty of peace. During this period, there had not been an appearance of the enemy, a movement by them, or the slightest occurrence of rumor to raise a suspicion of truth for this intelligence. Not a disbelief it was expressed by anybody or from any quarter.
