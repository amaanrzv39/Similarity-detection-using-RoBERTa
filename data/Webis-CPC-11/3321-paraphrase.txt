He was in the best of moods.  He discussed rich and immense farm and gold-mines.  He was going to leave for a job, but planned on returning to buy a home in the country-because he already had one in mind-and he would play while being surrounded by friends and everything he enjoyed.  We went our own ways, and would not meet again.  While traveling back to the coast with a small party he became lost, and there was never a trace of him found. His friends always held onto his memory and saw him as having amazing courage, happiness in the worst of times, always helping others, and unmoving stiffness.  Could a man like him be considered a failure?  I do not feel it could be so.  I will write again.  Until I do write I will always be,

HOW TO KNOW THE SEASON. -"Handsome's Girls!" The sweet young girls will be bought for the low amount of a single penny! about this small amount, -with out notice of a higher charge,-a person can buy the Holiday Number of the One Cent Illustrated, which has Mr. SCOTT CLEMENT "our departed friend" (going around the world - "country hopping"), starts off with some good lines.  Laureate, will he be picked?  He is gone; and most really good poets seem to be "missing."  The Editor, that great spinner of tales, writes one of his best stories yet, painting a picture in the mind for us of Miss ELLIE NORE.
