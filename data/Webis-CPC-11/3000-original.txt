Notes on habit are given below in the accounts of the various families. In general it may be
stated that beetles live and feed in almost all the diverse ways possible for insects. There
are carnivores, herbivores and scavengers among them. Various species among those that are
predaceous attack smaller insects, hunt in packs crustaceans larger than themselves, insert
their narrow heads into snail-shells to pick out and devour the occupants, or pursue slugs
and earthworms underground. The vegetable-feeders attack leaves, herbaceous or woody stems
and roots; frequently different parts of a plant are attacked in the two active stages of the
life-history; the cockchafers, for example, eating leaves, and their grubs gnawing roots.
