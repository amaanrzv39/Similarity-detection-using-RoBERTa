Possibly beaver have increased along the Mancos River.
The muskrat, mink, beaver, and raccoon usually occur only along the Mancos River, as there
is no other permanent surface water in the Park.

Species such as the bighorn and the marmot that are rare within the Park, or those such as
the chickaree, the prairie dog, the wandering shrew, the montane vole, and the long-tailed
vole that occupy only small areas of suitable habitat within the Park are the species most
likely to be eliminated by natural changes, or through the activities of man.
