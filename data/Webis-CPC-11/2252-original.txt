Literature had not yet acquired that importance in France
which it was so soon to obtain. The Encyclop√¶dia was still unconceived, and the momentous work
which that famous design was to accomplish, of organising the philosophers and men of letters
into an army with banners, was still unexecuted. Voltaire, indeed, had risen, if not to the
full height of his reputation, yet high enough both to command the admiration of people of
quality, and to be the recognised chief of the new school of literature and thought.
