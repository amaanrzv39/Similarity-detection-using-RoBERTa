I've been had before.  When I was in the Army there was a young man who used to come to my room and talk about funerals until I was sick of looking at him.  He would say things like, "Funerals are fairly sound stunt, aren't that?"  If you come to me tomorrow and want to talk to me about dead aunts, uncles and other things, I should have all sort of inquiries made that will surprise you.
