Princess Louise, not following the norm for British princesses, married the Marquis of Lorne in 1871. Their daughter, six years later on October 24th, was baptised in the first royal christening in Scotland for three hundred years. 

The Duke of Edinburgh, Alred, married the sister of the Czar, and the only daughter of the then-deceased Emperor of Russia.
