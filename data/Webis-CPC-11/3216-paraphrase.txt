It was wise that colored men should be placed in our armies. There were good soldiers and good Union men who thought it was unwise. They feared that Mr. Lincoln was going fast and too far, but events justified it. 

Now, everybody agrees that in both cases Abraham Lincoln was right. Now, the example of those Union men during the war who doubted the wisdom of these other measures. Greatly as they were opposed to the proclamation of Abraham Lincoln, strongly as they were opposed to the enlistment of colored soldiers. 

I say to you I never heard of one good Union man, in the army or out of it, who left his party because of that difference with Mr. Lincoln.
