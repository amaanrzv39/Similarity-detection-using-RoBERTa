The king as a man bewitched by the bishop of Rome, the very firebrand and bellowes of all the
ciuill warres in Christendome, neglecteth the remedies and conditions of peace that haue bene
offred, and perseuereth according to his beginning, in his hostile intendement against her
Maiestie, not otherwise contentable or satisfiable then with her destruction, the slaughter
and bloodshed of her people most obedient vnto her, and to bee short, with the conquest of
the whole kingdome.
