It is only at the last that the mere physical courage of the soldier reasserts
itself, and Macbeth, driven to bay by Fate, fights with the fierce energy of despair.

As to Rossi's Lear, it is not to be criticised. Words fail when the heartstrings are thrilled
to trembling and to tears. The pathos of Lear's recognition of Cordelia was past the power
of words to describe. He stands at first gazing in vague bewilderment at the face of his child,
then into the darkened and troubled gaze steals anew the light of reason and of recognition:
unutterable sorrow, inexpressible remorse, sweep across the quivering features, and with an
inarticulate sob Lear would fain sink on his knees at his wronged daughter's feet to pray for
pardon.
