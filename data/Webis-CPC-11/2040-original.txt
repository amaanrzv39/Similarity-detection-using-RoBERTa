Carrying heavy lumbering wooden furniture
to the woods of Upper Canada is as "coals to Newcastle." The black walnut makes handsomer furniture
than mahogany, and does not so easily stain, a property which saves much scrubbing and not
a little scolding in families. In clothes, boots and shoes are most useful, for Canadian leather
resembles hide, and one pair of English shoes will easily last out three American. In Canada,
a sovereign generally fetches 23s. or 24s. currency, that is 5s. to the dollar;--1s. sterling,
passes for 1s.
