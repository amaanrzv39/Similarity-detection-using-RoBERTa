Study of the tumors of mice display a somewhat larger susceptibility to tumor formation in the progeny of mice who have evolved tumors. Studies of human families appear to display that heredity has a minor leverage, but in the frequency of tumors such statistical clues is of little value. The inquiry of inheritance has much bearing on the source of tumors. If the tumor is unintentional and due solely to extraneous determinants, inheritance is not probable; but if there is some predisposition to tumor formation in certain persons due to some peculiarity, then inheritance may use an influence.

The inquiry as to if tumors are an expanding origin of infection is identically tough of solution.
