It is situated at about half a mile's distance from the shore, whence a long
reach of sand ascends rapidly to a height of about three hundred feet. This reach is about
eighty feet wide, and resembles an amphitheatre, being walled in by low rocks. The sounds coming
up from the ground at this place recur at intervals of about an hour. They at first resemble
a low murmur; but ere long there is heard a loud knocking, somewhat like the strokes of a bell,
and which, at the end of about five minutes, becomes so strong as to agitate the sand.

The explanation of this curious phenomenon given by the Arabs, is, that there is a convent
under the ground here, and that these sounds are those of the bell, which the monks ring for
prayers. So they call it "Nakous," which means a bell. The Arabs affirm that the noise so frightens
their camels when they hear it as to render them furious. Philosophers attribute the sounds
to suppressed volcanic action--probably to the bubbling of gas or vapours underground.

There are two sorts of extinct volcanoes: first, those in which all evidences of activity have
entirely ceased; and, secondly, those in which a subdued state of activity lingers. The former
are more widely distributed than the latter; but sometimes both kinds occur in the same district
of country.

Extinct volcanoes are found in the district of Auvergne in France. Solidified streams of lava
occur at Volvic near Riom; and the crater whence they descended is still visible on the top
of the Puy de Nugere.
