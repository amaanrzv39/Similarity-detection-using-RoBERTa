My fellow cattlemen and I rode around the animals, forming a half circle and spread out.  We gathered the cattle, as they remained silent, and drove them towards the house.  

My own ride behaved the way a horse should, keeping the business at hand in mind.  I had barely gotten more than a couple hundred yards away from the rest of our group when my mustang decided it was time for horse-play.  Barely a full mile away were mustangs at another plantation and my horse caught wind of their scent.  He began to prance and leap, manuevering his body in such an extraordinary way that I didn't quite believe my eyes.  My mustang was showing off:  leaping, prancing, rearing and playing around as though the devil had hold of him.  It was hard to stay on and, although I'm a seasoned rider, I was unable to stay on.  To my regret, I remembered I didn't bring my lasso and didn't heed Mr. Neal's advice, which was to put on my Mexican bit.  Without my lasso and the proper bit, any amount of horsemanship I could display would be useless.  The beast galloped five hundred yards as though possessed, caring naught for my vain attempts to stop him.  Suddenly he stopped short, a few yards from the trio of mustangs he had worked hard to intimidate.  My mustang threw his hind feet into the air with such force, that I was sent soaring out of my saddle, over his head.
