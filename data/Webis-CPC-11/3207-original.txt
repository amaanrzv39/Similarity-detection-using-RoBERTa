Except a dispute between the Doctor and Osgood concerning a slouched hat, which the Doctor
would not wear, the party succeeded in starting and arriving amicably at the Union in Saratoga.
In a few hours Mrs. Formica knew who was there. The Trees were at the Union. Mrs. Senator Conch
had taken a cottage; but the Senator himself had stopped at Albany for a day to confer with
the Governor. Old Madam Funchal of Philadelphia was at Congress Hall, with her train, and Mrs.
Romeo Pipps Bovis and husband, from Boston. All her friends were round her; that is, the traveling
set she was in the habit of meeting; and her spirits rose to the occasion. These particulars
she detailed, in a white muslin morning-dress, to Osgood, who, dressed in a new cream-colored
suit, lounged in the doorway of a small parlor off the hall.
