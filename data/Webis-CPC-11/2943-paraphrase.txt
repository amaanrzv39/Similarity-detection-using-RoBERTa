Now the strings produce the latter with ease, but the wind instruments, particularly the wood winds do not. It is almost impossible to get a delicately sustained piano from wind instruments.

The players, flautists particularly, have transformed their formerly delicate instruments into impressive tubes (Gewaltsrohren). French oboists, who have preserved the pastoral character of their instrument, and our reed, when they make use of the "Echo effect," are the exceptions.

This drawback, which exists in our best ensemble, suggests the question: why, at least, do not conductors try to equalise matters by demanding a somewhat fuller piano from the strings? But the director do not seem to notice any variability.
