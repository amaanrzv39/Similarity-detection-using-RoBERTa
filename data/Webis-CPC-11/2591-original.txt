A translation must reproduce
these features, whatever it fail to do. Passing existing translations in review, he finds Cowper
slow, Pope artificial, Chapman fanciful, Newman, through the vice of his theory, ignoble. Some
one having pronounced Tennyson eminently Homeric, Mr. Arnold discusses the relation of the
English idyllic to the Ionian epic poet, and finds him at the opposite pole in respect of simplicity.

As to a vehicle for the translation of Homer, he gives his voice decidedly in favor of English
hexameter, and tries his own hand at that measure. His success strikes us as respectable, but
not eminent. Blank verse he thinks too slow in movement, and too much opposed in character.
