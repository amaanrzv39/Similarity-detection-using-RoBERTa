I must confess that the man who jests on gender relations is to me far more than the man who sustain clean, but completely illegitimate sex relations, and while I am aware of a strong movement of friendship to a boy to recognize as an impurity in his life, but retains respect to purity, it is hard to feel anything but revulsion against that profanes the subject of sex with Coarse and ribald talk.

Following two evils of which I spoke now with the physical effects of masturbation, young people are powerless to deal with sexual temptations of manhood, and many, which in all other relationships of life are admirable, sink into the mud problem prostitution or less demoralizing, but far crueller, sin of seduction.

Thrown on the streets, usually through no fault of her, often only a love of over-confidence, prostitute sinks to lower depths of degradation and despair. This is not just that it is sold at every corner, clean and cool, even without the excuse of appetite or passion, which should be given only to love, but also that to make so it poisons the body and mind with spirit drinking, lead a life of indolence and self-indulgence demoralizing, cut from all decent associations, and sinks under the combined influence of these things and fell disease, in a loathsome creature would not the lowest, immersed in poverty, misery, suicide, or outcast's early grave.

The contamination of this hell, the active support of this cruel infamy, many and many a young man driven by an impurity in childhood. Such at least is the conclusion of guys who know best.
