I hear from Newmarket, that I missed an extremely pleasant week's racing--and although my selection
for the Stud Produce Stakes was rather wide of the mark, I fairly hit the bullseye--(what a
painful operation this must be for the bull)--in my one "Song from the Birdcage," which I warbled
in the ear of a racing friend whom I met down here; it was Ã  propos of the July Stakes and
ran thus:--

  The night was dark when "Portland Bill" escaped by Chesil Beach!
  And hope beat high within his heart, that he the goal might reach!
  For "Milford" Haven lies in sight!--one effort and he's there!
  But see!--At last--he's caught!--he's passed!--just by the Judge's
          Chair!
