Reverend John C. Emery is the present pastor.

The St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church was originally built in 1831, but replaced in 1854 by a larger structure.  It was consecrated by Bishops Fitzpatrick and O'Riley in 1854.  Reverends Mahoney, Connelly, McDermott, Tucker, and O'Brien have been the pastors.

A free church of the Christian denomination was organized by Reverend Col in 1833.  It was an experiment that failed and the building was later turned into an armory.

The Freewill Baptist Church built a structure for religious worship in 1837, just three years after it was organized in 1834.  The property was managed poorly and later used as a commercial property.  The society then build another building for worship and the pastors were Reverends Thurston, Woodman, Curtis, Moulton, Davis, Mott, Bean, Drew, Marham, Dame, and Porter.

In 1836 the Second Universilist Church was organized in 1836 and in 1837 they built a structure for their worship purposes.
