I consider him to be a credible source of information. Dr. Collins states that his predecessor, Dr. Joseph Clarke, noted a unique condition which seemed to be plaguing children who died shortly after their birth. In the year 1784, he noted that this had occured in nearly one of six children. He atributed the amount of these deaths to contaminated air in the hospital.
