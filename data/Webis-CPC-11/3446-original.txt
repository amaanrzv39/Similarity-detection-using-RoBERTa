Or do you think he's sleeping? (No answer.) Don't you think father's probably asleep
half the time he's supposed to be working?

Barbara. Probly. What you got in that bag?

Julia. I expect that big armchair he sits in is just a weeny bit too comfy for real work.

Barbara. I've eated up all those choc'lates you did bring me.

Julia. Perhaps we'll find some more presently. Do you think Father writes in his sleep?

Barbara. Yes, I fink he does.

Julia. Listen to her, Suzie. I expect really he only dreams he's working. Don't you, Babs?

At this point I thought it advisable, for the sake of preserving the remnants of my parental
authority, to come in to tea. Julia was handing Barbara a packet of chocolate, and greeted
me with an arch inquiry as to whether I had been busy writing. I replied with a hearty affirmative.

"You ought to hear what your daughter has been saying about you," said Julia.

"Oh, and what does Barbara say?" I asked.

"She says that when Father sits in that stuffy little room of his he usually writes in his
sleep. She really does take the most amazing notice of things, and the way she expresses herself
is quite weird."

"So Barbara says I write in my sleep?"

"Yes, you heard her, didn't you, Suzie? Oh, and did I tell you that the other day, during that
heavy thunderstorm, she said that the angels and the devils must be having a big battle and
that she supposed the angels would soon be going over the top?"

"Come here, Barbara," I said.
