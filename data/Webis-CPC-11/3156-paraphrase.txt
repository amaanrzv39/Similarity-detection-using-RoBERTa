Meeting an electrician, who is a friend of mine, and also a great mathematician, alike all those of is status, is very precise in his statements, I uttered, in all the enthusiasm of emotion brought into existence by such a wonderful event,--

"Isn't it wonderful, this thought of the ability of sending our lightning clear across the ocean, and speak with Paris and London as easily as we can do with New Orleans and New York?"

"Yes it is," my friend answered, with the exact same excitement; "my desires by this glorious invention are more than realized."

"Desires realized!" I uttered. "I never believed there was a remote chance of this really coming into existence,-- did you?"

"Of course," said my mathmatical genius friend; "I did not think the odds were really against us with this endeavor."
