The safeguards bill was proposed by the Government of Ireland in 1886. This bill was extended in 1893. Recent speeches of Ministers suggest that proposals which will be submitted to parliament soon will not be much different from the 1893 bill. For convinient dicussion we can assume the content of the 1893 bill as a passed by the House of Commons. A Bill was introduced into Irish legislation. This Bill was supposed to pass both Houses. In the event of disparity between the Houses the proposals of the Legislative Assembly were to be submitted to the join Session of the two Houses. This would happen after a dissolution or a delay of two years.
