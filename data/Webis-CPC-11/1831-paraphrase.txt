Where the bigger streams flow out to the bays, the western area is surrounded by hills interrupted occasionally by sandy, flat plains.  Large mountains rise straight up between Dellys and Philippeville with just a small beach area left.  The mountains fall away to the east of Philippeville and the ridge of hills returns.  The coast is really only flat and sandy for large areas between La Calle and Bona.
