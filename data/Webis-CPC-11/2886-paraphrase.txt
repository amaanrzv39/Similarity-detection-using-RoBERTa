HAMILTON

To the People of the State of New York:

IT IS at times requested, with an air of looking like triumph, what inducements could the States have, if disunited, to make combat upon each other? It would be a full reply to this query to say--precisely the matching inducements which have, at divergent times, deluged in life-force all the territories in the world. But, sadly for us, the query admits of a more actual answer. There are reasons for of divergences in our instantaneous contemplation, of the leaning to of which, even under the restraints of a central government constitution, we have had enough understanding to empower us to configuration a judgment of what might be looked frontwards to if those restraints were removed.
