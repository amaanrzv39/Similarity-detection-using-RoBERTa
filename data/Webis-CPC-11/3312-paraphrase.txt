[Footnote: Official Records, vol. xxxviii. pt. v. pp. 85, 89, 93.] With this, Johnston made the decision to quit the north bank or the river. Instead he found a good position behind Peach-tree Creek in order to defend the area around Atlanta. He had burned bridges, including the railroad bridge as he passed through the area.

It took a few days for Sherman and McPherson's group to reach Roswell which was twenty miles beyond the railroad tracks. They built a bridge so supplies and other things could pass that way and spent time trying to organize how things would be moved without the railway. The army arrived at the Chattahoochee on the 17th. McPherson was positioned to the left and Schoneld near to his men. Thomas' command was at the center and a bit to the right. The plan was to drive the enemy troops to Atlanta.

At the same time the Confederate government and General Johnston found themselves in a crisis. Although he let them know of his troops movements he neglected to let them know his plan of action. On the 5th day of July, he moved back into a place where the Chattahoochee crosses. He sent word that "As the enemy advances closer to the river on our left, we have picked this spot and are digging in".[Footnote: Official Records, vol. xxxviii. pt. v. p. 865.] Davis sent a reply on the 7th of July expressing his fears about this, indicating that this position may be a dangerous one. He said that there were no reinforcements available and he could not send more troops and now the whole situation depended on the success of Johston.
