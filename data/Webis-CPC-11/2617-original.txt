This may be rendered evident by observing, that the noise always ceases when the insect
alights on any object. The sirene has been ingeniously applied for the purpose of ascertaining
the rate at which the wings of such creatures flap. The instrument being brought into unison
with the sound produced by the insect, indicates, as in the case of any other musical sound,
the rate of vibration. In this way it has been ascertained that the wings of a gnat flap at
the rate of 15,000 times per second. The pitch of the note produced by this insect in the act
of flying is, therefore, more than two octaves above the highest note of a seven-octave pianoforte.--Lardner's
