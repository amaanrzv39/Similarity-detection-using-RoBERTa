Casts can be removed from their molds by minute heating of the mold, but this often results in breaks.  Less affected by condensation of the air's water are insulators, only beaten by fused quartz.  Insulators are unfortunately weal and often crack with exposure to daily temperature changes, but despite this, their electrical properties make them extremely useful.
