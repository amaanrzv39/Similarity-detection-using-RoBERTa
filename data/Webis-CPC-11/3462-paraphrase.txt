I don't know how  a lot years it is since, as "MILES AMBER," she captured my admiration with that wonderful former fresh,  Wistons; and already here is her second, Sylvia Saxon (UNWIN),  alone just appearing. I may say at once that it fully proves my impression that she is a author of very actual and original gifts. Sylvia Saxon is not a harmonious book. It is steely, many than a little sour, and  consciously unsympathetic within treatment. But it is grimly real. Sylvia herself is a spirit  that stays, and her mother, Rachel, almost eclipses her within this equivalent quality of disastrous vitality. The  complete tale is a tragedy of unfilled and meaningless stays   traversed within an atmosphere of too much finance and too little significance. The "society" of a Northern manufacturing plutocracy, the display and rivalry, the marriages between the enriched  households, the absence of any regular except wealth--all these things are predetermined down with the minute realism that  ought  arrive,  I am sure, of sexual personal knowledge. Sylvia is the  children of one such relations, and mated towards the decadent heir of another. Her tragedy is that too late she greets a man whom she imagines capable of  granting her the fuller,  many finalise life for which she has always ignorantly yearned. Then there is Anne, the penniless girl,  rented  as a child towards  be a playfellow for Sylvia,  whom  herself  relishes  the equivalent man, and dies when his dawning affection is ruthlessly dusted away from her via the dominant personality of Sylvia. A tale, one powers dub  it, of unhappy women; not made the less grim via the fact that the man for whom they  battled is guided as entirely  unworthy of such emotion.  A  mighty, interrupting and greatly original story.
