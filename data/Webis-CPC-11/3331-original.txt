I forgot to mention she added a very minute piece of mace, not enough to make its
flavour distinguishable; and that the coffee-pot must be of tin, and uncovered, or it cannot
form a thick cream on the surface, which it ought to do. After it was taken, for the last time,
from the fire, the cup of water, which had been poured from it, was returned. It was then carried
into the room, without being disturbed, and instantly poured into the cups, where it retained
its rich cream at the top."

"Thus made, its fragrance filled the room, and nothing could be more delicious to the palate.
So far from its being a long and tedious process, as it may appear in narrating, old Kamalia
allowed herself only two minutes for each person; so that from the time of her leaving the
room to her return, no more than eight minutes had elapsed."

To interesting sketches we can only add a scene of sea sport off Fort Rotterdam, at Macassar,
an island between Java and Borneo; shaped like a huge tarantula, a small body, with four disproportionately
long legs, which stretch into the sea in narrow and lengthened peninsulas. The locale is

Shark's Bay.

"My hawk-eyed Arab now pointed out to me a line of dark spots, moving rapidly in the water,
rounding the arm of the sea, and entering the great bay. At first I thought they were canoes
capsized, coming in keel uppermost; but the Arab declared they were sharks, and said, 'The
bay is called Shark's Bay; and their coming in from the sea is an infallible sign of bad weather.'
A small pocket-telescope convinced me they were large blue sharks. I counted eight; their fins
and sharp backs were out of the water.
