The inhabitants do not reckon on the ground being covered by snow more than
three or four months. They turn their cattle into the woods in March and April, but the lake
remains full of floating ice until May. On the 12th of May, 1821, the steam-boat could not
proceed on account of the ice. From an adjacent eminence, the lake was seen to be covered with
it in one compact mass, as far as the eye could range. As might be expected, remittent and
intermittent fevers are very prevalent in the autumn.
