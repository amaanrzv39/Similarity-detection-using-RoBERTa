Learning through intellectural activities can make up physical limitations. I kind of learnd how to bowl through reading the Cricket Field daily and nightly and by working at least five hours a day. This was a quite accomplishment considering i was in a bowlerless country. People treated me much higher in the sporting society than i really was, especially if you consider we were still reading Bell's Life in our remote parts of the pastoral districts.
