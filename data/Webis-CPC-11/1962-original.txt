Virginia! The land of battlefields and battle gore, colonial relics and Revolutionary monuments,
spotless fame and unsullied honor; the land of patriot soldiers and heroes, and of a Yorktown,
where the tyrant's head was bruised and the glorious strife ended which struck from our fathers
the fetters and gave to them and their posterity a country gleaming in the golden sunlight
of republican liberty, and throwing wide open her gates to the oppressed of every clime.

Virginia!
