He considerably stirred things up-- especially the enemy. His trade was sniping; for two hours every single morning, every ten minutes a Corporal brought him drinks in order to keep him cool, and a Sergeant spotting for him. He had made notches on his dug-out post to mark the number of Huns he had killed. He would etch in a notch every time he rang the bell,and before the first month he had been with us had passed that post could have easily passed as a four foot saw.

"Of course the Huns were annoyed. Let me just say, we were outstanding and they were outstanding, and between us there was less than one hundred yards. We could clearly hear them when they ate, when there was food to be had, and when there wasn't they smoked horrible smelling cigars, which contained a more horrific odor than all the gas they had ever expelled. On a certain day the Sub. arrives for his morning practice and notices a large sign over the enemy trench: 'We are Saxons. Don't shoot.'
They had alleviated they Prussians and were bustling about their trenches as free as a Band of Hope outing.

"Unless it is proved to be the contrary,' our Sub. states., I retain the belief that Saxons are Germans.' And, he adds,'war is war,' and three notches had to be added to his post in order to make them undertand that he was malevolent. When they did begin to understand they began to attack us, and they continued to attack harshly for the remainder of the day. Our Sub. had had enough by the time night fell. He said, 'Boys, on hour before sunrise them Germans are gonna be run out of that trench,'he said, We shall not make a frontal attack, due to the fact that some of us could rip our clothing on the enemy's traps and housewives are a rarity.
