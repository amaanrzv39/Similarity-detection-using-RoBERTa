The wetness that lies in the atrium outside, making the grass and flowers come up around the Bysantine pillar which goes over a pine cone, hase gone into the flat roofed nave an dlarge aisles, kepping it apart from a colonnade. A green mold is in the holes in the walls, rent around by land slides and quakes. The cipolline columns holding the round arches on square capitals are dull, and thire green veined mable looks like wood that has been long forgotten.
