We can even include Conjuring! Early-printed books on all these subjects
are legion, and the numerous works on Lycanthropy or Werewolves, must also find a place under
this heading. Claude Prieur's curious work is rare though not particularly valuable; it is
a duodecimo printed at Louvain in 1596, and is entitled 'Dialogue de la Lycantropie ou transformation
d'hommes en loups, vulgairement dit Loups-garous . . . .' Books on Monsters must also be included
here.
