Wordsworth's poem of 1815 told that influence of Natural Objects in calling forth and strengthening the Imagination in Boyhood and Early Youth. It also reveals that identification of God with nature. Mr. Stopford Brooke writes that we are here in contact with a Person, not with a thought. Who is that person he told? Sometimes she only a creation of imagination, having no reality beyond the mind of Wordsworth.
