Until the end of the Eocene period the entire region that is the topic of this study was ocean. What we now know as the mountains of Sinai were isles in this ocean and were spread over parts of Europe, Asia and Africa. When the Miocene stage started however, the continental crust shifted due to lateral contraction, which caused the ocean bed to rise. This created fissures, folds and faults along lines ranging north and south. The most significant impact was seen in the Jordan-Arabah valley. The mountains of the lebanon that were previously flooded, being part of the ocean during the Eocene and Cretaceous eras, were lifted above sea level. In the process, the strata suffered massive erosion and denudation, giving the Jordan Arabah Valley its first form. 

There had not been a any volcanic activity as of yet, but that changed at the beginning of the Pliocene period. A massive volcanic outbreak affected the land in a number of ways. As volcanoes erupted, craters formed all over the area, spewing lava and ashes, along with cones of slag into the air. The lava filled the rents and fissures in the landscape, while the wind carried the ashes and the slab over towards the area East of the Sea of Galilee and the great Arabian desert. During the Glacial or Pluvial era the volcanic activity continued. By the time that the first people arrived in the region, the volcanic activity had stopped.
