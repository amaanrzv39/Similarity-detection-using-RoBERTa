We have been taught to pray for our rulers. While we do this we can not be
rebellious. Who is so blind as to not see that the Scriptures will control our citizens with
more benevolence than any other book or any other maxims or set of opinions. When the Christian
Scriptures are duly regarded and their divine authenticity respected designing, ambitious,
corrupting and aspiring politicians will have but little power to plunge us into crimes and
sufferings.

The most important of all our social institutions is the marriage. It is the paternal source
of all other relations. There is no exhibition of the divine goodness in conditioning our race
that is more significant and lovely. By it our world is a collection of families in which the
tenderest affections are cherished and the worst generally subdued. Here there is a community
of interests. Here we experience the highest motives to a virtuous influence, especially in
forming the character of the youth of our country. The race is continually multiplying and
enlarging. What wonderful wisdom was it that consulted its honor, its virtue and eternal destiny
by the appointment of the marriage relation? It was the best method upon which human society
could be organized. There are narrow-hearted, lustful bigots who would do away the social family
compact. They talk about “free thought,” “free love,” no restraints of law, no protection of
the mother save the voluntary.
