The work might be anything
that wanted doing, so long as the hours of prayer were not infringed. Agriculture, scholarship,
education, handicrafts and art have all been done perfectly by St. Benedict's sons, working
and willing in quiet love. This is what one of the greatest constructive minds of Christendom
regarded as a reasonable way of life; a frame within which the loftiest human faculties could
grow, and man's spirit achieve that harmony with God which is its goal. Moreover, this life
was to be social. It was in the beginning just the busy useful life of an Italian farm, lived
in groups--in monastic families, under the rule and inspiration not of a Master but of an Abbot;
a Father who really was the spiritual parent of his monks, and sought to train them in the
humility, obedience, self-denial and gentle suppleness of character which are the authentic
fruits of the Spirit. This ideal, it seems to me, has something still to say to us; some reproof
to administer to our hurried and muddled existence, our confusion of values, our failure to
find time for reality. We shall find in it and its creator, if we look, all those marks of
the regenerate life of the Spirit which history has shown to us as normal: namely the transcendent
aim, the balanced career of action and contemplation, the creative power, and above all the
principle of social solidarity and discipleship.
