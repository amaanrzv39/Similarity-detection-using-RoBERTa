Bad Food for Chickens

Three week old chicks should be strong and sturdy. If the chick seems dumpy and droopy, it could be ill. The head appears heavy and the neck straigtens out lengthwise.

When the fowl is sick, do not feed anything but mash three times a day. When no significant improvement is seen in a few days, the bird should be killed and bodies burned, immediately.
The fowl could have contracted a violent and deadly disease which could spread to the whole flock.
