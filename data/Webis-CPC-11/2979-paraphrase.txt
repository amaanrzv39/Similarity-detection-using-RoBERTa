While there was no sign of El Drado in New
France yet people always searched for the 
vein of gold or silver.The clonists in every
generation spent years of labour in search
of the deluding wealth.
Here mention should be made of the brewing 
industry set up by Talon which progressed 
a lot for a short period but did not survive
after his death.In establishing the brewery
in Quebec the founder had two things in his
mind,one to reduce large consumption of eau-
de-vie by providing a cheap and more wholesome
substitute and secondly to provide the farmers
of the colony with a profitable market to sell
their grains.
