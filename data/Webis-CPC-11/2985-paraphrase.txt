Some will say how lighting could possibly light trees on fire, that thunderstorms usually follow burning, dry temperatures and that if lighting were to ignite a tree with any flammable material nearby the inferno would branch out and the ancient civilizations would flee. A teacher might ask if those people would start fearing the fire as a monster; if not, you could just say that it might have just looked as if the trees were getting eaten and recieve "The people would just assume it was a wild beast". As the story continued, it would tell how Bodo, just a little boy, would see the "monster" shrink in size and, as he approached it, fed it some fuel and grew to welcome its radiating heat after the downpour that accompanied storms-- what could make the monster shrink?-- discovered and no beast would come closer and so on.
