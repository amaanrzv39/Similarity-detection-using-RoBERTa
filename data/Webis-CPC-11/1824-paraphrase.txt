Naval Atrocities.--In the story on "Wounds," in the Encyc. Brit., 4th edition, published 1810, the writer, after having mentioned the need for a surgeon to be careful in characterizing any wound, added that "this is particularly important on board ship, where, as soon as any man is considered by the surgeon to be mortally wounded, he is immediately and while still living and conscious, thrown overboard," or similarly worded, as I quote from memory.
