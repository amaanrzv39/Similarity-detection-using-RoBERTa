He made two marches farther,--not now direct for Berlin, but direct for
Saxony AND it;--to Lubben, 50 or 60 miles straight south of Berlin; and halted there some days,
to adjust himself for a new sequel. "These are the things," exclaims he, sorrowfully, to D'Argens,
"which I have been in dread of since Winter last; this is what gave the dismal tone to my Letters
to you. It has required not less than all my philosophy to endure the reverses, the provocations,
the outrages, and the whole scene of atrocious things that have come to pass." [OEuvres de
Frederic, xix. 199; "22d October."] Friedrich's grief about Berlin we need not paint; though
there were murmurs afterwards, "Why did not he start sooner?" which he could not, in strict
reason, though aware that these savageries were on march.
