For his paintings Rembrandt probably used various etching needles of different widths.We do not see the typical changes caused by re-etching. A minor penetration of acid was caused by re-etching of new lines crossing previously etched lines under the ground into the old lines. It is visible in the printing as a dark spot at the point of crossing.This effect is not found in this print.When drypoint lines cross etched lines a similar result is obvious in the cross-hatching at the lower left. There is no confirmed evidence concerning the acid corrosive used by Rembrandt to bite his plate. Only vague conclusions can be drawn from this and other prints.
