There is no evidence whatever adduced to give even the semblance
of colour to this unfortunate error; whereas, on the side of the Wistaston family, the proofs
of its identity as the family of Mrs. Milton are numerous and, to my notion, incontrovertible.

As if, indeed, to give us "confirmation sure" of the truth of this position, our old friend
CRANMORE starts up, "like a spirit from the vasty deep," and, after an absence of many months
from our ranks, pays off his ancient score by producing the evidence he so long ago promised
us.
