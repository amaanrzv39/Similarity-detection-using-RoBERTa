I finally told the dispatcher that Nos. 21 and 22 were in the ditch when i realized something had to be done. The dispatcher snapped back at me, "Damn it, I've been expecting it, and have ordered the wrecking outfit out from Watsego. You turn your red-light and hold everything that comes along. In the meantime go wake up the day man. I want an operator there, and not a ham."


The half dressed day man came in and said, "Well, what the devil is the matter?"

I lost my ability to speak so I just pointed to the order and the breakman told him the rest. I have never spent a night like that ever in my life. The day man was talking to m e about charming little incidents, about men he knew, who, for having been criminally negligent, had been shot by infuriated engineers or had been sent up for ten years.
