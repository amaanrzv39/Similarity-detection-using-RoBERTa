Nature takes care of that. I defy you to walk along any street in London and see six porpoises
and a whale! That is what I saw this morning. Oh! of course you may counter by telling me that
neither can I see an automobile or a fire engine, but I have you, because I can answer that
I have seen them already. How are you going to get out of that corner, except by saying that
you do not want to see the old porpoises and whales and bergs?--and I know your "Scotch" conscience
forbids such distortion of facts.
