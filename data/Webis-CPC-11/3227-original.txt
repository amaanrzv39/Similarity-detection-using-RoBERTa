We threaded muddy lanes, and wandered among
bewildering wharfs, and mounted lofts and sheds, and squeezed ourselves into all sorts of out-of-the-way
slums. We climbed ladders leading up into creaking timber galleries, and got into regions of
old planks and cobwebs, dim with dust and odorous with ancient smells. We assailed the scholar
at his studies, and the craftsman at his labour, and from all and each we met with a courteous
reception, and gathered the sinews of benevolence. The dispositions of men vary in few things
more than in their several modes of conferring a favour. Some of our most liberal donors thoughtfully
sent their bank-notes to the vestry, to save us the trouble of waiting upon them; others, on
the contrary, levied the full value of their gifts, by keeping us wearily waiting before we
got them.
