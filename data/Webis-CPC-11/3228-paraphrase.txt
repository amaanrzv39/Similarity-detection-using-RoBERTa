Collecting money for the church is not only a daunting take, but can take you places you may never have frequented before.  Muddy roads, isolated shoreline piers, desolate tenements and cottages nestled in the hills.  We've seen them all, and once there, we were made to scale ladders, delve into stench filled cellars, and fend off angry canines protecting their territory, just to complete our mission.  We visited the teacher, the lawyer, the housewife, the farmer, and were welcomed by all, for they knew our purpose.  People are like small streams, each taking their own path to the end, and this is more evident when it comes time to giving alms.  Some will have already put the check in the mail, while others will stall as if you might change your mind, yet others make you endure an eternal wait while they painstakingly fill in the check, as if to suggest it adds value to the gift.
