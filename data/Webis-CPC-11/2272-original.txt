I have always considered as a fable, what I have been told of the breasts of a Moorish woman,
but am now convinced of my error. I have seen (to cite no other examples), I have seen, I say,
one of these women teazed by one of her children, throw them one of her breasts with such force,
that it reached the ground.

Their male children can scarcely walk, when the mother treats them with the same respect as
her husband, that is to say, prepares food for them, and will not eat herself till her son
has been served.
