Think that the honour of
God and the salvation of souls is being sweetly seen. You ought not to want or desire anything
else. You could do nothing more pleasing to the highest eternal will of God, and to mine, than
feeling thus. Up, my daughters, begin to sacrifice your own wills to God! Don't be ready always
to stay nurselings--for you should get the teeth of your desire ready to bite hard and musty
bread, if needs be.

I say no more. Bind you in the sweet bands of love, so you will show that you are daughters--not
otherwise.
