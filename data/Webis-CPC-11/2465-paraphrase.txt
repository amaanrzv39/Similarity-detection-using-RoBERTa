Gordon's mission was to  withdraw the Egyptian garrisons and civilians. According to Earl Granville it was a peaceful one.  Gordon send a positive statement in a telegram  of March 8th.
         Earn Granville instructed him to sent away Zebehr as he would be more powerful than Mahdi as he would make short work of th Mahdi.
           Last week Gordon closed a telegram with these words I will try my best to carry out the instructions but I have a feeling that I shall be caught in Khartum.
