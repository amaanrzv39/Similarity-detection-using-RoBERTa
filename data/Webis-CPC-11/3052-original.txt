SPEECH OF MR. JOSEPH S. ROPES.

FELLOW-CITIZENS,--I thank you for the honor you have done me in inviting me to preside on this
auspicious occasion. You have come together to-night, not to quarrel with one another's politics,
not to abuse one another's rival candidates, but to hold a friendly consultation upon one of
the most important and interesting and agreeable subjects which can engage your attention,--the
subject of public parks for the city of Boston. [Applause.]

Gentlemen, I was born in Boston; and I well remember the time when our cows were pastured on
Boston Common, when the Back Bay was not a myth, but a reality, and when at least a portion
of the summit of Beacon Hill was covered with green fields, on which were seen sometimes "raree
shows" and travelling menageries.
