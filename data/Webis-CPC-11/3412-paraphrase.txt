Mrs. M.) Oh! oh! oh! Miss A.)

Philip. What is your recipe, Frank, to end disagreements between husbands and wives?

Beverly. Wives are to give up studying their needs, and try to understand their husbands.

Miss A. What is the result?

Beverly. All men, rather than remain single as I become enamored of domestic life. No man could resist the idea of being constantly entertained, waited for, admired, flattered. And once married, a man's house would become so fascinating to him than ever, except against their will, in return for his club or the lounge of his neighbor's wife.

Miss A. And in exchange husbands are willing to give a pleasant sense of their needs and study to understand their wives?

Beverly. Not at all: they are too stupid to understand their wives, there is something very fine and difficult to reach the women's intellect and heart that must be achieved by one of our sex. Moreover, these things never the same - two souls just enough and never, unlike understand exactly? That women to perfect the art of giving happiness and good deed will command its own reward.

Miss A. Do you understand, Jenny, what the law is full of women? For my part I think it is better to stick to the old style, it is said that "a mill, a clock and a woman always wants to fix." I think women have their own requirements shortly.
