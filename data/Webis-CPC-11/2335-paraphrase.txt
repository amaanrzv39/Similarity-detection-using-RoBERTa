SUB-KINGDOM 6

SPERMAPHYTES: PHAENOGAMS

The final and largest division of the kingdom of vegetables is named Spermaphyta, or "seed plants," due to the fact that seeds are unique to them. Another common name for them is "flowering plants," although this term is more appropriate of a small group of higher pteridophytes.

With few exceptions, the macrosporangia in seed plants stay attached to the parent plant until the archegonia fertilize and form a plant embryo.
