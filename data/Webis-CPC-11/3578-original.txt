He possessed a powerful arm, which he wielded
with very considerable freedom when applying the birch in the recesses of the boot-room. I
must admit that my interviews with Father St. John in the boot-room were not infrequent. But,
after all, the immediate effect soon passed away and the incident was forgotten. Still, to
my surprise, when the school accounts were rendered at the end of the year, my father was puzzled
over one item, namely, "Birches--Â£1 2s. 6d." (at the rate of half a crown each)! He asked me
what it meant, and I explained to him as best I could that dear Father St. John was really
the responsible person in the matter, and I had no doubt my father would get a full explanation
from him if he wrote. But it brought home to me the recollection of nine visits to the boot-room
with that amiable and much-respected Father St. John. I have within the last few months met
again, after my long absence in other countries, several of my school mates. They are all going
strong and well, holding high positions in this world, and as devoted as ever to the old school
at Edgbaston. One of them is now Viscount Fitzalan, Viceroy of Ireland.

When my two elder brothers left the Oratory, which I may say was a school where the boys were
allowed very considerable liberty, my father must have thought, no doubt, when he remembered
the twenty-two and sixpence for birches, that it would be wise to send me somewhere where the
rules of the college were, in his opinion, somewhat stricter.
