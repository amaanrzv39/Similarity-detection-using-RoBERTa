For a while it has been noticed, that the artic  regions latitude is a long from being a factual suggestion of the cold temperature that could normally by expected from a closer approach to the pole itself. For example, in certain parts of the latitude cold is more extreme 60 degrees than in 70 or 77 degrees: in the different districts of the coast  as well as the changing seasons this can change very much: in passing we might say, when Britian experiences a uniquely mild winter, in the artic regions the exact opposiste happens; and vice versa. The amazement of Captain Penny on founding the new polar sea in question was increased by the fact, that it had a much more warm climate than the latitudes of the south, it was also full of fish, and the shores were plentiful with birds as well as animals.
