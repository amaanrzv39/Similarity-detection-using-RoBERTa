Were the Celtic tribes aware with it previously of the arrival of the Phoenicians upon our shores?


It is rumoured that the Phoenicians owned money  from Tyrian Hercules for their trade in tin; and this land owed them in the name of Baranatac,or Britain, the land of tin. Was he afterwards known and worshipped as the Melkart of Tyre and the Moloch of the Bible?  Was he the  Merchant -Leader of the first band of Phoenicians  who visited this island?
