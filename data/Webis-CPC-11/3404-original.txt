I did expect to see the
day, and, although I shall not see it, it must come at last, when he shall be treated as a
madman or an impostor who dares to claim nobility or precedency, and cannot show his family
name in the history of his country. Even he who can show it, and who cannot write his own under
it in the same or as goodly characters, must submit to the imputation of degeneracy, from which
the lowly and obscure are exempt." Good old Penn, too, is made a lay figure upon which Landor
dressed his thoughts, when the Quaker tells Lord Peterborough: "Of all pride, however, and
all folly, the grossest is where a man who possesses no merit in himself shall pretend to an
equality with one who does possess it, and shall found this pretension on no better plea or
title than that, although he hath it not, his grandfather had. I would use no violence or coercion
with any rational creature; but, rather than that such a bestiality in a human form should
run about the streets uncured, I would shout like a stripling for the farrier at his furnace,
and unthong the drenching horn from my stable-door." Landor could write his name under that
of his family in as goodly characters, therefore he was not ashamed to relate anecdotes of
his forefathers. It was with honest satisfaction that he perpetuated the memory of two of these
worthies in the "Imaginary Conversations" between King Henry IV. and Sir Arnold Savage, and
Oliver Cromwell and Walter Noble.
