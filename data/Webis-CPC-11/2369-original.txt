From the days of slavery Negroes have tried the fortunes of the market place and under freedom
their enterprises have increased in number and variety. At the present time Southern-born and
West Indian Negroes form the bulk of the business men, the latter far in excess of their proportion
in the Negro population. This success of West Indians is partly a result of training and initiative
developed in a more favorable environment, as they had the benefit of whatever opportunities
their West Indian surroundings offered.
