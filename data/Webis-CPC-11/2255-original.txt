It
certainly is true that very many people do not hear half of the sounds that go on about them,
sounds which, if but heeded, would teach people a great deal. And of all people, those who
study music should be particularly attentive to sounds of all kinds. Indeed, the only way to
begin a music education is to begin by learning to listen. Robert Schumann, a German composer,
once wrote a set of rules for young musicians. As it was Schumann's habit to write only what
was absolutely needed we may be sure he regarded his rules as very important.
