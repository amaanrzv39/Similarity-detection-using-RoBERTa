Even if we take the literal narrative of the Gospels and accepted that all I have known of Christ, but we allow any imaginative interpretation of the central figure, an ideal we should get it, I will not say very different from that or St. Francis. St. Theresa, but even that of the English prayer-book. People loved and adored Christ is an ideal of their hearts, building a personality ever present, living and intimate understanding of fragments of story and doctrine in relation to a name. The subjective image inspired prayers, all conversions, all penances, charities, and sacrifices, and half the art of Christendom.

Virgin Mary, whose legend is so weak, but whose power over the Catholic imagination is so great, is a clear illustration of just how active this building until a perfect form. Everything is nice here extend spontaneously given by two events: the Incarnation and Crucifixion. Figure Virgin Mary, found in the powerful scenes, is clarified and developed gradually until I reached the first thought of her freedom from original sin, and secondly because of universal motherhood. We thus reach the conception of one of the most noble and possible role of one of the most beautiful characters. It is unfortunate that a bad iconoclasm deprived Protestant mind so much from the contemplation of this ideal.
