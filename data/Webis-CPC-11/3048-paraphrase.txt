Some people may regard that one of the vices of food reformers is exaggeration. However, one can safely say that Mr Eustace Miles and the restaurant associated with his name have played an important role in bringing about the more sympathetic attitude towards "food reform" noticeable on all sides.

Mr Miles admits that he has expertise in the area of advertising. The advertisement have been important in influencing people to accepting food reform, people who are repelled by the out-and-out "vegetarian" propaganda.

There are a lot of people who dislike the introduction of manufactured or artificial food into the health movement.
