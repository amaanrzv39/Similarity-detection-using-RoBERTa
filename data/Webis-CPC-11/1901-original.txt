There are three or four of these Latin hymns that for simple force and pathos have never been
matched in their kind, and never approached, except by a few of the more fortunate poems of
Herbert, Vaughan, and Quarles. We know not why it is that what is called religious poetry is
commonly so bad. The thing gives the lie to both the adjective and the noun of its title. Anything
more flat and flavorless, whether in sentiment or language, is beyond the conception even of
an editor with the nightmare.
