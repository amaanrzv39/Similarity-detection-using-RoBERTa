Christabel and Kubla-Khan; The Skylark, The Cloud,
and The Sensitive Plant (in its first two parts).  The Eve of Saint Agnes and The Nightingale;
certain of the Nocturnes;--these things make very quintessentialised loveliness.  It is attar
of poetry.

Remark, as a thing worth remarking, that, although Shelley's diction is at other times singularly
rich, it ceases in these poems to be rich, or to obtrude itself at all; it is imperceptible;
his Muse has become a veritable Echo, whose body has dissolved from about her voice.
