On they
fled, and the men would gladly have lightened the ship by casting the cargo overboard; but
the captain watched the hatches with a sword and two bronze-tipped spears in his hand. He would
sink or swim with the ship; he would go down with his treasure, or reach Sidon, the City of
Flowers, and build a white house among the palms by the waters of Bostren, and never try the
sea again.

So he swore; and he would not let them cast the Wanderer overboard, as they desired, because
he had brought bad luck. "He shall bring a good price in Tanis," cried the captain. And at
last the storm abated, and the Sidonians took heart, and were glad like men escaped from death;
so they sacrificed and poured forth wine before the dwarf-gods on the prow of their vessel,
and burned incense on their little altar.
