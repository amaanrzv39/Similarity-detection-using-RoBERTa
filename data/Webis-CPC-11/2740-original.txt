The Priest is, therefore, not at liberty to consume what remains at this period of the
service.

In arranging 'what remaineth of the consecrated elements,' the cover previously used, and not
the paten, should be placed upon the chalice. The fair linen cloth, or veil, should be large
enough to cover thoroughly the whole of both chalice and paten, when the paten is placed in
front of the chalice. It should be observed, that the employment of the word 'linen' excludes
a fabric of other material, such as silk or cotton.

129. After shall be said as followeth, O Lord and, &c.

130. Or this, Almighty and, &c.

131.
