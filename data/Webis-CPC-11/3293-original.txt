We should not be far wrong in dating them 1493-5.
Carpaccio's influence is also apparent, as we have already noticed, and through this channel
Giorgione's art connects with the more archaic style of Gentile Bellini, Giovanni's elder brother.
Thus in him are united the quattrocentist tradition and the fresher ideals of the cinquecento,
which found earliest expression in Giambellini's Allegories of about 1486-90. The poetic element
in these works strongly appealed to Giorgione's sensitive nature, and we find him developing
this side of his art in the Beaumont "Adoration," and the National Gallery "Epiphany," both
of which are clearly early productions. But there is a gap of a few years between the Uffizi
pictures and the London ones, for the latter are maturer in every way, and it is clear that
the interval must have been spent in constant practice. Yet we cannot point with certainty
to any of the other pictures in our list as standing midway in development, and here it is
that a lacuna exists in the artist's career. Two or three years, possibly more, remain unaccounted
for, just at a period, too, when the young artist would be most impressionable. I am inclined
to think that he may have painted the "Birth of Paris" during these years, but we have only
the copy of a part of the composition to go by, and the statement of the Anonimo that the picture
was one of Giorgione's early works.
