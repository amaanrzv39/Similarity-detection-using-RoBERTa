You have been so much to me, and
helped me so often, that I feel you must be born to help others as well.  And this quiet time,
it may be that God is using it to call you closer to Himself, to teach you to revise your 'values,'
to show you a new fund of strength.

    Our wills are ours, we know not how,
  Our wills are ours, to make them Thine.

You must--literally must--let His will overpower your will.  Nothing but complete sacrifice
will satisfy you or Him, and I believe in you profoundly.
