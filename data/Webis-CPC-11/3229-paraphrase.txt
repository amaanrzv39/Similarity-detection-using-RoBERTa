One day Mochuda was keeping his herd beside the river. Suddenly, he heard the bishop and his clerics pass by, chanting psalms as they went along. The boy was touched by the Spirit of God and he left his pigs and followed the procession as far as the monastery called Tuaim (Druim Fertain) (into which the clerics entered). Mochuda concealed himself when the clercis sat down to eat. At the same time, Maoltuile noticed the boy's absence and got worried about him. A lot of messengers were sent to search the boy. Finally, the boy was found by one of the messengers in the shadow of the doorway of the bishop's house.
