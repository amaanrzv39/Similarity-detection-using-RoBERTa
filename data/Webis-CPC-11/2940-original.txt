The ship buzzes with activity. The guns on deck are hastily housed. Bridge appurtenances
are housed also, and sailors dive down through the deck-holes. The commander follows. Water
begins to gurgle into the ballast-tanks while the crew seal every opening. Down goes the U-47-1/2
until only her periscope shows, a periscope painted sea-green and white--camouflaged. The eyes
of the watch-officer are glued to the periscope.

"She is a Dutchman, sir," he says at length. The commander steps to the periscope and takes
a look. The Dutchman has no wireless and is bound for some continental port. It is not wise
to sink every Dutch boat one meets--although German submarines have sunk a sufficient number
of them, in all conscience.
