Forster, in his "Researches about Atmospheric Phenomena," notices several prognostics of the
weather by plants. Thus, Chickweed has been said to be an excellent weather-guide. When the
flower expands freely, no rain need be feared for a long time. In showery days the flower appears
half concealed, and this state may be regarded as indicative of showery weather; when it is
entirely shut, we may expect a rainy day. If the flowers of the Siberian sowthistle remain
open all night, we may expect rain next day.
