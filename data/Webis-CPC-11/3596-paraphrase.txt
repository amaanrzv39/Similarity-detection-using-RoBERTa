Ether was written about very provacatively by Sir Oliver Lodge; among other things, he claimed that it's inherent energy equalled that of what a million-killowatt generator could produce in 30 million years, and that this energy exists, untapped by us, in every inch of space.  As amazing as this is, it is probably still an underestimation. 


If this is the case, however, how it is possible that human beings are even able to lift their limbs in a solid that is, Lodge claims, multiple orders of magnitude denser then platinum? It is actually not so far to imagine the answer to this: that substances with difference densities can actually permeate eachother quite easily. So just as water can pass through fabric, so can ether pass through a solid mass--even a physical body.  A ghost and a living human may walk right through one another, and neither know it's happened.  These being, these "astral forms," can walk through a wall, a rock, a tree just as easily as you or I walk through the air. And we living creature remain unconscious of these astral ones because, since our beings are governed by LOGOS, we can only sense others that are also of this type.  We can see and feel and experience only those forms that are manifestations of God.
