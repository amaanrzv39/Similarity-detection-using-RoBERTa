Agreeableness pays off. After you bought Higlinson's Blacking Cream, you found out it worked just like the store brand, and you kept on using it. This was all good for Mr. Higlinson's business, and it made him as rich as Donald Trump, but in other ways, it wasn't good. For years, he wouldn't give interviews, and he stayed out of the public spotlight. To the public, he wasn't a real person at all, just a name on the bottle of shoe shining gel they used to clean their boots.
