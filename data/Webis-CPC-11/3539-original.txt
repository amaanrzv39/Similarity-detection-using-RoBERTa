Happy--to
pass graver considerations--the fair one whose countenance continues as youthful as her attire!

He who has "neither done things worthy to be written, nor written things worthy to be read,"
takes the trouble of transmitting his portrait to posterity to very little purpose. If the
picture be a bad one, it will soon find its way to the garret; if good, as a work of art, it
will perpetuate the fame, probably the name, indeed, of the artist alone. These are the obscurorum
virorum imagines which, as Walpole said, "are christened commonly in galleries, like children
at the Foundling Hospital, by chance"--Q. Rev.

LOSING A SHOE AND A DINNER.

As Ozias Linley, Sheridan's brother-in-law, was one morning setting out on horseback for his
curacy, a few miles from Norwich, his horse threw off one of his shoes. A lady, who observed
the accident, thought it might impede Mr. Linley's journey, and seeing that he himself was
unconscious of it, politely reminded him that one of his horse's shoes had just come off. "Thank
you, madam," replied Linley; "will you then have the goodness to put it on for me?"

Linley one day received a card to dine with the late archbishop of Canterbury, who was then
bishop of Norwich. Careless into what hole or corner he threw his invitations, he soon lost
sight of the card, and forgot it altogether. A year revolved, when, on wiping the dust from
some papers he had stuck on the glass over the chimney, the bishop's invitation for a certain
day in the month (he did not think of the year one instant,) stared him full in the face, and
taking it for granted that it was a recent one, he dressed himself on the appointed day, and
proceeded to the palace.
