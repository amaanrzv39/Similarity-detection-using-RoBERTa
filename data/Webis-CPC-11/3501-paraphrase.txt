t appears to be difficult to get the tungsten to alloy, and it has to be added to allotment of the chestnut as phosphide of tungsten, in appreciably greater abundance than is assuredly required. The nickel is added to allotment of the chestnut and the phosphide of tungsten, again the zinc, and again the blow of the copper. The admixture requires to be remelted several times, and a acceptable accord of tungsten is absent by oxidation.

The admixture is of a accomplished white colour, and is actual little afflicted by air--in fact, it is to some admeasurement untarnishable. The specific attrition will be apparent to be about one and a bisected times greater than that of German silver, and the temperature accessory is about 0.021 per cent per amount C. (i.e. about nineteen times beneath than copper, and bisected that of German silver). To all intents and purposes it may be admired as German argent with 1 per cent to 2 per cent of tungsten. It does not arise to accept been decidedly advised for civil changes of resistance.

118. German Silver. This actual has been absolutely advised of backward years by Klemencic and by Feussner and St. Lindeck. Everybody agrees that German silver, as commonly acclimated for resistances, and composed of chestnut four parts, zinc two parts, nickel one part, is actual ill-fitted for the purpose of authoritative attrition standards. This is due (1) to its experiencing a ample access in attrition on winding. Feussner and St. Lindeck begin an access of 1 per cent if German argent was anguish on a amount of ten wire diameters.

(2) To the actuality that the change goes on, admitting with gradually abbreviating rate, for months or years;

(3) to the actuality that the attrition is assuredly afflicted (increased) by heating to 40В° C. or over.
