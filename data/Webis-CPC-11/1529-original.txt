The damp that lies in the atrium outside, making the grass and poppies sprout
round the Byzantine pillar which carries a cross over a pine-cone, has invaded the flat-roofed
nave and the wide aisles, separated from it by a single colonnade. A greenish mildew marks
the fissures in the walls, rent here and there by landslips and earthquakes. The cipolline
columns carrying the round arches on their square capitals are lustreless, and their green-veined
marble looks like long-buried wood.
