The head of M. Alexandre was blown off during the itervention of the Rue Gambetta and the Rue Carnot.  The Germans barged into the shop of M. Breche selling wine and noticing that he was not offering them immediate wine pulled him to the area of neighbour Mme Egasse where a person of high rank blamed him for shooting their army and commanded to shoot him down inspite of his plea of refusal.  Mme Egasse did his best to soothe the killers, but was mercilessly rejected down.  Later, as she went to her room, she became aware of the charges and viewed the body of Breche through the window, spread on the ground.  Coming to the spot she could not stop showing her sorrow.  The Officer then expressed to her "A dead man".
