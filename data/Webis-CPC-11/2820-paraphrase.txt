After finishing her mother's work in the evening  she will sit under the sky and call her children and talk to them in Dutch as it was the only language she know. It was the only thing that she can do to help and protect them.  Translation of it in English is as follows.
            There is a god in the heaven who can see and hear you. When you are ill treated by others seek the help of him. He is the only person that we can rely upon.  He is able to save us from all trouble. Then she taught them to kneel and  the Lord's prayer. She warned them from stealing  and lying, asked them to obey their masters.
