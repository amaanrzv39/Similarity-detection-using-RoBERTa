In the heat of the summer, we reminisced as we wandered around the yard, remembering the games we had played among the bushes, flowers and trees when we were young.  After we had laughed over the fun we used to have together, we went into the house and soon found ourselves in Grandma's room, where we began to discuss grandma, and Bobby as well.  

It wasn't any time at all before the day was done and night had fallen.  Lottie and I shared a room, and we were up far into the night chatting.  Lottie was much more worldly about men than I, which made me blush in my naivete, but finally she got me feeling comfortable enough that I could even check out my two older cousins, which, to my surprise, I did with relish.  Even then, though, my own dear brother, in my mind always cherished as a sweet grade school tyke, was never out of my mind.

How had I grown this old without realizing that my mother was Grandma's oldest child? That being the case, Bobby would be the owner of Beecham Park, rather than Harry, who was the child of my dear uncle, now passed.  Bobby had not taken the news gracefully.  When Grandma related this information to him, he stammered something and later told me how disappointed he was about his new responsibilities.  "I was planning to be an explorer, not a boring old estate owner.  I wanted to travel to darkest Africa, have adventures, wander around and get lost like Dr. Livingstone, but guess what? Looks like I won't get to do any of that now!"  

Right before bed he had come over to me, put his arm around me, and whispered, "Well, at least it won't happen to me for a long time, thank goodness.  And when I do finally have to come live here and be in charge, will you come and live here too, dear sister?  I'll let you take care of everything, and that will make the whole thing much better, won't it?"
