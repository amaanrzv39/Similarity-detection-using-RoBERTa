He was buried with honour in his own
city--in Declan's High-Place--in the tomb which by direction of an angel he had himself indicated--which
moreover has wrought wonders and holy signs from that time to now.  He departed to the Unity
of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost in Saecula Saeculorum; Amen.  FINIS.

The poor brother, Michael O'Clery originally copied this life of Declan in Cashel, from the
book of Eochy O'Heffernan.  The date, A.D., at which that ancient book of Eochy was written
is 1582.  And the same life has now been re-written in the Convent of the Friars at Druiske,
the date, A.D., 27th February, 1629.

NOTE

The Irish text of the "rann" from paragraph 26 reads:

Ailbe umal; Patraicc Muman, mo gacrath, Declan, Patraicc na nDeisi:  na Deisi ag Declan gan brat.
