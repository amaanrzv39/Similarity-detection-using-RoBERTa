Some doubt still rests
upon Egyptian chronology. By certain antiquaries, this ring is supposed to have been worn by
the Pharaoh who ruled over the land while Joseph was prime-minister; but others, as has been
mentioned, place the reign of Amenophis I. after the departure of the Israelites.

The other is a diadem of pure gold, about seven inches in diameter, taken from the head of
a mummy. In the centre, a pyramid rises with a double cartouch on one side and a single one
on the other. Towards this twelve scarab√¶i are approaching, six on either side, emblematic
of the increase and decrease of the days in the twelve months; and between these is a procession
of boats, in which are deities and figures. In the inner side of this diadem the signs of the
zodiac are represented.

Among the jewellery in this collection we find several valuable necklaces in gold, coral, and
precious stones. Besides the Egyptian, there are some of Etruscan origin, taken from the tombs
of this ancient people. We cannot leave this subject without noticing the beauty and perfection
of the filigree-work, executed about 2400 years ago, and equal to modern workmanship. Some
exquisite specimens from Pompeii are preserved here.

Turning now to the walls of this apartment, we find glass-cases filled with vases in terra
cotta and eastern alabaster. On some of these are royal names, gilt and coloured; that of Cheops,
the builder of the great Pyramid, occurs on one.
