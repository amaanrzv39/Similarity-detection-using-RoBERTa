The old man made us stay to dinner; but then he hurried us off, that we might be over The Mountains
before dark.

The air was chilly when we started, and a few snow-flakes were flying. But we had everything
to make us comfortable. The old horse always stepped quick, going home; the wind was in our
favor; our chaise had a boot which came up, and a top which tipped down. We should soon be
home. There is nothing very bad, after all, in being sent for a girl you never saw!

And we were not two dummies.
