Annual reviews
of Schiller literature appear in the Jahresberichte fuer neuere deutsche Litteraturgeschichte
and in the Berichte des Freien Deutschen Hochstiftes. Valuable especially for its English titles
is the bibliography compiled by John P. Anderson for Nevinson's Life of Schiller, London, 1889.

EDITIONS

During the lifetime of Schiller his writings were printed in different forms by different publishers,
and owing to the absence of copyright unauthorized reprints were numerous.
