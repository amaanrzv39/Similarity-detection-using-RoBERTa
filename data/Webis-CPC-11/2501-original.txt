In
Cymbeline, Act iii. Sc. 2., we read:

  "Senseless bauble,
  Art thou a feodary for this act, and lookst
  So virgin-like without?"

where feodary clearly means confederate, associate. According to some, the word signifies one
who holds land by the same tenure as the rest of mankind; whilst Mr. Knight, in a note on Henry
IV. Part i. Act i. endeavors to show that it includes both the companion and the feudal vassal.

"To owe" is frequently used by Shakspeare in the sense of to possess, to own, as in Act i.
Sc. 5. where Lucio says:

  "But when they weep and kneel,
  All their petitions are as freely theirs
  As they themselves would owe them."

So also in the following instances:--

  "The slaughter of the prince that ow'd that crown."
