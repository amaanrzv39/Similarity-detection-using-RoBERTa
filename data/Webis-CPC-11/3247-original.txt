The ox is guided by a string tied to a ring in his
nose, but neither the configuration of his back nor his gait are to be recommended for comfortable
rides.

Most of the roads of Santo Domingo can be called roads only by courtesy. They are generally
little more than trails of greater or less width. The larger receipts enjoyed by the government
since the customs collections were taken over by Americans in 1905, have caused a little improvement.
Thus, a first-class macadam road has been constructed from Santo Domingo City to San Cristobal,
a distance of sixteen miles; the old trail from Santo Domingo to San Pedro de Macoris has become
available for automobiles; and the royal road in the Cibao from La Vega through Moca and Santiago
to Monte Cristi, a distance of about 100 miles, formerly a horror, has been converted into
a fair dirt road. The amount of work to be done appears all the more appalling when it is considered
that in the small island of Jamaica, less than one-fourth the size of the Dominican Republic,
there are 1000 miles of fine roads. The American authorities in the island are giving considerable
attention to the improvement of the principal highways around and between the more important
cities, and valuable work is being done. By an executive order of November 23, 1917, the military
governor appropriated $650,000, to be expended on portions of a trunk road which is ultimately
to connect Santo Domingo, La Vega, Moca, Santiago and Monte Cristi.

The majority of the roads and trails have scarcely been touched since their course was fixed,
centuries ago.
