This original work is dedicated to Pius II after he was elevated to the papal throne.  This is evident in the dedication copy, which fixes the approximate date of his elevation to the throne in August of 1458.  In April 1460, Jacopo Zeno was translated to the Sea of Padau.  

The manuscript was excuted and decorated in keeping with its special use.  The preface which occupies 10 papges is introduced by heading letters in burnished gold.
