The magnitude of the service rendered by Churchill to the Prince of Orange, immediately appeared
in the commands conferred upon him. Hardly was he settled at William's headquarters when he
was dispatched to London to assume the command of the Horse Guards; and, while there, he signed,
on the 20th December 1688, the famous Act of Association in favour of the Prince of Orange.
Shortly after, he was named lieutenant-general of the armies of William, and immediately made
a new organization of the troops, under officers whom he could trust, which proved of the utmost
service to William on the unstable throne on which he was soon after seated. He was present
at most of the long and momentous debates which took place in the House of Peers on the question
on whom the crown should be conferred, and at first is said to have inclined to a regency;
but with a commendable delicacy he absented himself on the night of the decisive vote on the
vacancy of the throne. He voted, however, on the 6th of February for the resolution which settled
the crown on William and Mary; and he assisted at their coronation, under the title of Earl
of Marlborough, to which he had shortly before been elevated by William. England having, on
the accession of the new monarch, joined the continental league against France, Marlborough
received the command of the British auxiliary force in the Netherlands, and by his courage
and ability contributed in a remarkable manner to the victory of Walcourt.
