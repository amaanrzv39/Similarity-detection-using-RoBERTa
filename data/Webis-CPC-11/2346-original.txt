How free-born citizens complain, with many Yankee curses,
  Of fate which fills, in spite of them, their coffers and their purses.
  How, if the man be only poor, there's nothing that can stop a cit
  In Yankeeland, while here with us the case is just the opposite.
  How honest British working-men who fail to fill their larder
  Should sail for peace and plenty by the very next Cunarder.
  And how, in short, if Britishers want freedom gilt with millions,
  They can't do wrong to imitate the chivalrous Brazilians.
