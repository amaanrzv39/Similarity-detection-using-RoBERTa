And how often have the world's great voices been discovered by chance, but fortunately by some
one empowered to bring out the latent gift!

One finds in America many beautiful voices, and when one thinks of the numerous singers successfully
engaged in operatic careers both here and abroad, it cannot with justice be said as it used
to be several years ago that America does not produce opera singers. Naturally a majority of
those to whom I give a hearing here in New York are Americans, and of these are a number of
really remarkable voices and a fairly good conception of what is demanded of an opera singer.

Sometimes, however, it would be amusing if it were not tragic to see how much off the track
people are who have been led to think they have futures. One young man who came recently to
sing for me carried a portentous roll of music and spoke in the deepest of bass voices. When
asked what his main difficulty was he replied that he "didn't seem to be able to get on the
key." And this was apparent when he started in and wandered up and down the tonal till he managed
to strike the tonic. Then he asked me whether I would rather hear "Qui sdegno," from Mozart's
"Magic Flute," or "Love Me and the World is Mine." Upon the latter being chosen he asked the
accompanist to transpose it, and upon this gentleman's suggesting a third lower, he said: "No,
put it down an octave." And that's where he sang it, too. I gently but firmly advised the young
man to seek other paths than musical ones.
