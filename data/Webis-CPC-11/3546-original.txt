At the present moment, I can only announce the project as a stimulus to unemployed aspirants,
and as a hint to fortunate collectors, to prepare for an exhibition of their cryptic treasures.--On
a future occasion I shall describe the plan of construction which seems more eligible--shall
briefly notice the scattered materials which it may be expedient to consult, whether in public
depositories, or in private hands--and shall make an appeal to those whose assistance may be
required, to enable a competent editor to carry out the plan with credit and success.

On the prevalence of anonymous writing, on its occasional convenience, and on its pernicious
consequences, I shall make no remarks. Facts, rather than arguments, should be the staple commodity
of an instructive miscellany.

BOLTON CORNEY.

NOTES FROM FLY-LEAVES.--NO. 1.

Many scholars and reading-men are in the habit of noting down on the fly-leaves of their books
memoranda, sometimes critical, sometimes bibliographical, the result of their own knowledge
or research. The following are specimens of the kind of Notes to which we allude; and the possessors
of volumes enriched by the Notes and memoranda of men of learning to whom they formerly belonged,
will render us and our readers a most acceptable service by forwarding to us copies of them
for insertion.
