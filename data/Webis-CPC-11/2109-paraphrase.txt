If it was off, there was no reason why I should not hammer it to square-leg, a stroke which has become vogue since my time, but back then, you did not frequently see it in first-class Cricket. It was seen as "an agrarian outrage." Foreigners and ladies found Cricket to be a most buoyant diversion if all the world, and especially LEWIS HALL and SHREWSBURY, played on my principles. Innings would would be shorter. Fewer matches would be drawn. The fielders would not get sick.
