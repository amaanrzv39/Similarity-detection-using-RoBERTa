The claims of human duty come again into full force; benevolence is active; suffering
and disappointment, forgotten in sleep, press with new weight on weary hearts. What a mighty
change one hour has made!

Long has the night of heathenism and of wickedness ruled over the world. "Darkness has covered
the earth, and gross darkness the people." But the gun has fired and "THE MORNING COMETH."
The nations once wrapped in gloom are waking to life and truth.
