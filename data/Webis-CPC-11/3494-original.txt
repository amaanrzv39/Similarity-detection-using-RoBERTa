The Flatterer is a false friend clothed in the garb of a true one. He speaks words from a foul
heart through fair lips. His eyes affect to see only beauty and perfection, and his tongue
pours out streams of sparkling praises. He is enamoured of your appearance, and your general
character commands his admiration. You have no fault which he may correct, or delinquency which
he may rebuke. The last time he met you in company, your manners pleased him beyond measure;
and though you saw it not, yet he observed how all eyes were brightened by seeing you. If you
occupy a position of authority whence you can bestow a favour which he requires, you are "most
gracious, powerful, and good." His titles are all in the superlative, and his addresses full
of wondering interjections. His object is more to please than to speak the truth. His art is
nothing but delightful trickery by means of smoothing words and complacent looks. He would
make men fools by teaching them to overrate their abilities. Those who walk in the vale of
humility amid the modest flowers of virtue and favoured with the presence of the Holy One,
he would lift into the Utopian heights of vanity and pride, that they might fall into the condemnation
of the Devil. He gathers all good opinions and approving sentiments that he might carry them
to his prey, losing nothing in weight and number during their transit. He is one of Fame's
best friends, helping to furnish her with some of her strongest and richest rumours. But conscience
has not a greater adversary; for when it comes forth to do its office in accusation or reproof,
he anticipates its work, and bribes her with flattering speech. Like the chamelion, he changes
his appearance to suit his purpose.
