dark periods, when the belief of magic was universal, not only amongst the lower ranks, but
with the learned and educated classes of the community, it was reported that the Wizard, having
cast his own horoscope, had discovered that his death was to be occasioned by a stone falling
upon his bare skull. With that anxiety which clings to life, he endeavoured to defeat the demon
whom he served, and by repeated incantations constructed this magic casque, which he vainly
deemed invulnerable.
