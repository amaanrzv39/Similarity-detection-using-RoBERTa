It is quite possible, of course, to appreciate, pleasantly and externally,
the Iliad with its pressure of thronging life and its daring unity, and the Odyssey with its
serener life and its superb construction, though much more sectional unity. But we do not appreciate
what Homer did for his time, and is still doing for all the world, we do not appreciate the
spirit of his music, unless we see the warfare and the adventure as symbols of the primary
courage of life; and there is more in those words than seems when they are baldly written.
