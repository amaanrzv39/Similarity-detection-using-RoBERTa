The ideas for illustrations in the afterwards journals were incomplete, and did not suggest, in all instances, with enough definiteness to sanction them to be implemented, the modifications from more typical strategies and creations planed by the translator. It has, consequently, been resolved to embrace in this part of the work only those illustrations which are famous to have had the full commendation of Professor Morgan. The one omission to this belief is the reproduction of a bumpy type of the Ram of Hegetor, built by me on the foundation of the measurements bestowed by Vitruvius and Athenaeus. 
It does not look like to me needed or even advisable to move into into a long debate as to the day of the year of Vitruvius, which has been ascribed to assorted intervals from the time of Augustus to the early centuries of our era.
