The twine must be
fastened to four of the arms, and the tail of the kite should be covered with green paper,

=Rochester Edge Tools in England.=

Some time since, a Mr. Ash, an extensive manufacturer of Mechanics' Tools at Sheffield, England,
sent to this country for patterns of the latest improvements, and amongst the rest, ordered
a variety from Messrs. Barton & Belden of Rochester, which were promptly forwarded. On their
arrival there, it seems that their make gave such universal satisfaction, that they were immediately
copied, and the fact that they came from this country made prominent, by stamping upon them
'Rochester Pattern.'

=An Animal Curiosity.=

Travellers state that there is on the island of St. Luce a cavern, in which is a large basin
twelve or fifteen feet deep, at the bottom of which are rocks. From these rocks proceed certain
substances that present at first, sight beautiful flowers, but on the approach of a hand or
instrument, retire like a snail, out of sight! On examination, there appears in the middle
of a disk, filaments resembling spiders' legs, which moved briskly round a kind of petal. The
filaments, or legs, have pincers to seize their prey, when the petals close, so that it cannot
escape. Under this flower is the body of an animal, and it is probable he lives on the marine
insects thrown by the sea into his basin.
