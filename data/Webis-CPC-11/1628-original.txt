We turned
in disappointment towards the encampment, scarcely extricating ourselves from the thickets
before it became dark. Having gained the sand-plain, we continued our return for several hours,
steering by the stars, hoping by a night march to avoid the scorching effects of the sun, which
at this season renders travelling over an extensive sandy plain very fatiguing. Having been
more than eleven hours in the saddle, we halted for the night.

4th October.
