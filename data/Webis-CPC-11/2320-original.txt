Then to church, and thank
God you are not as other men.

Live and talk as if you were to live for ever. If you have accumulated tens of thousands, try
and make them hundreds of thousands. Why should you retire and make way for the industry of
others, while you are able to treasure up more.

Give credit, take credit, live upon credit; if you are wealthy, your own money will be gathering
interest at the same time. If you are poor, you have no other means to live by.

In matters of business, let there be no favour.
