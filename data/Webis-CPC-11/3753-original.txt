The need of men and women today, as in all ages, is to learn to live together in love and peace--to
build up rather than to tear down, to cooperate rather than to compete, to find meaning in
life through open sharing with others rather than through narrow self-seeking.

Religion has always striven to further these goals, because they represent the spiritual development
of man. But again and again the simple truths spoken by great religious leaders have been lost
in the complexity of elaborate institutions and the lust for power.

Friends have been distinctive in their stubborn resistance to these diversions and distortions
of the simple truth that we must learn to love God and man, and that there is no other path
to redemption. In each new age, Quakers have found ways to witness to the way of love and the
way of peace.

May it be that a central calling for Friends today is to respond to the disintegration of marriages
and the alienation of the generations by finding in their own marriages, and in their family
relationships, a new quality of creativeness based on a deep and honest sharing of life? Can
love be spread abroad in the earth, if it cannot be nurtured in the close and intimate relationship
between man and woman, the nuclear relationship where love begins and where life begins? Can
one proclaim peace among the nations if unable to contrive to live in harmony with those under
one's own roof?

The mood of our age is compounded of hope and despair. We have achieved so much, in terms of
technological skill and power; and we have achieved so little, in terms of harmonious human
relationships. We have created the power to make this world, compared with what it has been,
a paradise for man to enjoy, but we have failed to make it possible for man to enjoy what has
been achieved.
