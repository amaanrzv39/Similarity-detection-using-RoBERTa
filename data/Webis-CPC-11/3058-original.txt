"They always refer to active
sexual performances or tendencies;" and, as Jones further explains, "there occurs early in
life an exaggerated divorce between the instincts of hate and love, and the conflict and antagonism
between the two dominate the most important reactions of the person.  A fundamental state of
doubt, an incapacity for decision, results from this paralyzing doubt. The patient oscillates
between the two conditions of not being able to act (when he wants to), and of being obliged
to act (when he doesn't want to). The symptom symbolizes the conflicting forces. These are
not, as in hysteria, fused into a compromise-formation, but come to separate and alternating
expression; one set of manifestations, therefore, symbolizes the repressed forces, another
the repressing."
