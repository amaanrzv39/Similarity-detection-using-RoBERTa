There is no need to thin apples from my tree. Enough fall off naturally. Personally, I fertilize my orchard with the use of clover and highly recommend it for all soils. However, pasturing my orchard I avoid always. My trees have annoying borers and my apples are bother by an annoying insect that stings and causes them to fall. Yet I do not spray. With care, I pick my apples by hand. Then I sort them into two classes and pack them in barrels, marked with variety by hand. Next I ship them to market in a lumber wagon. My best apples are put up for wholesale and vinegar is the result of the second and third grade apples that I harvest. Topeka is the best market for my apples, although I admit that I have not tried distand markets. I do not dry apples but store them in barrels in my cellar. From time to time, I also bury some. It is wise to repack stored apples before sending them to market, losing about one-eighth of them. Irrigagion is not advised. Price is currently fifty cents per bushel.
