But unions by continuous transition are the only
ones we know of, whether in this matter of a knowledge-about that terminates in an acquaintance,
whether in personal identity, in logical prediction through the copula 'is,' or elsewhere.
If anywhere there were more absolute unions, they could only reveal themselves to us by just
such conjunctive results. These are what the unions are worth, these are all that we can ever
practically mean by union, by continuity.
