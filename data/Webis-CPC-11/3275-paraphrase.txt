For the Chorus-Singers be in no way elected by Suffrage by all, but hir’d by the suitable Officer who was by the side of the Expence of the Chorus: in addition to the Furnishers of the Chorus have never any Table, or Stipend, permitted them, towards their accusation. In the direction of what Purpose subsequently is this Sentence, which be supposed to be a Deduction from the Premises, and yet is nothing, brought in? Or how comes the interpretation to be found upon what was not the Fact? The Mistake manifestly arises from a careless Transposition made in the Text: Let the two Greek Words, which I have notable by Capitals, only change Places, and we recover what Platonius intended to infer: “That the [A] Furnishers of Chorus’s being no longer selected by Suffrage, and the [B] Chorus-Singers having no condition made for them, Chorus’s were abolished, and the Subjects of comedy altered.”
