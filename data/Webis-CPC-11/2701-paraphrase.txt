His valour and sang-froid won the adoration of all. He was injured, but he looked after little for that; and before long after he was endorsed to the position of sub-lieutenant.

Gauthier was very intimate with Lieutenant Saussier, another heroic someone who had gone through the "baptism of fire" in Africa, and whose many valour and integrity have won for him the high bureau he now holds.

These two combatants were of the matching metal: they were competent to appreciate and understand each other, and were virtually inseparable.

One day as long as the siege of Sebastopol, Lieutenant Saussier said to his friend:--

"Gauthier, may I request you a question?"

"Two queries, if you like."

"You won't consider it simple curiosity?"

"Are we not acquaintances, Saussier?"

"Yes, but maybe this is a secret----"
