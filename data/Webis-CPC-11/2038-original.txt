The moon is said to be the scene of a life even more immersed in matter than the life on
earth.  Are there then material organizations living there?  If so, how do they dispense with
air and water, and how is it that our telescopes discern no trace of their works?  We should
much like a fuller account of the Adepts' view of the moon, as so much is already known of
her material conditions that further knowledge could be more easily adjusted than in the case
(for instance) of planets wholly invisible.
