I would suggest some comments to improve the works of this genre through its channel of value. 

I. I believe that none of the expected reference dictionaries to be published without the promise of a newspaper supplement every five or seven years, containing the subject and later intelligence. For example, the ease with which this can be given in the case of a Biographical Dictionary! To say that this work has been published in 1830 (which, it is believed, is the date of excellent Gorton Biographical Dictionary), the compiler of a supplement you can simply collect and organize monthly and annual obituaries journals since 1830 for common make a good and useful supplementary volume. 

II. I would suggest to the authors and booksellers working publish biographical dictionaries follow the French and American custom to include in them the most eminent contemporary characters life. That would greatly increase the use of the book, and the issue could easily be collected from actual books of the Nobility and Parliamentary Companion, with the help of the many magazines that are distinguished men of letters. 

III. Gazetteers supplements data could easily be the parliamentary papers and magazines of that time. I refer in particular to supplements published by Mr. McCulloch to his Dictionary of Commerce as an example to follow, while the conduct adopted recently in the new edition of the biography of Maunder's Treasury should be avoided.
