As a magistrate had, on oath, and against all power Glenallan family, legal investigations Earl's young wife's death. Indeed, during which she was staying at Knockwinnock Wardour Castle family twenty years ago, and while it was still known only as Miss Eveline Neville, antiquarian loved it and asked her to be his wife. It was, indeed, mainly on account of them had never married. Mr. Oldbuck not ceased to cry, and now, believing that he had good reason to do that because Earl was her premature death, and the stigma that rested on her behalf, it was surprising that he should want to have any relationship with him.

But Earl had a great need to speak to someone's heart. At a time when everyone seems to have changed for him. For the first time knew the truth about a dark act of cruelty. For the first time, also knew he had a son. He wanted above all wise counsel of a true friend. In his heart he admired the courage of antiquarian investigation was bold at the time of death of Eveline Neville, and now, refusing to be rejected, he followed Mr. Oldbuck as he was turning away, and demanded that he should should not deny him his counsel and assistance to a dire and critical moment.

This was not the nature of antiquarian good to refuse such a request from Earl or beggar, and interview them ended in Earl's accepting hospitality Monkbarns night because they could have plenty of time to discuss the subject throughout Elspeth's communication .

On his own part Mr. Oldbuck took some comfort to give Mr. Glenallan.
