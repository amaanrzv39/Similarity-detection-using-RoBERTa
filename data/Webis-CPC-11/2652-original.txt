This is one of an "order" to which belong the peacock, all pheasants
and tragopans (three forms which have their home in Central and Southern Asia), also the Guinea
fowls (African forms), and the turkeys and curassows, which are American representatives of
the order. Besides these may be mentioned partridges, grouse, black-cock, the capercalzie and
quails, and, lastly, the megapodius or bush-turkey of Australia. This last is the only bird
which hatches its eggs by artificial heat, depositing them in a mound of earth and decaying
vegetable matter, wherein they are hatched fully-fledged, so that they can fly away immediately
on leaving the egg. All the birds yet mentioned are called gallinaceous birds, or Gallin√¶,
and sometimes Rasores or "Scratchers."
