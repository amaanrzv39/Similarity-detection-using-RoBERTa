He was a very generous patron to the arts. To the palace of S. Marco, he brought architects of eminence from Rome, and hired Mino da Fiesole, a sculptor, and Giuliano de San Gallo, a wood-carver. At his expense, he restored the arches of Titus and Septimius Severus, the statue of Marcus Aurelius, and the horses of Monte Cavallo.
