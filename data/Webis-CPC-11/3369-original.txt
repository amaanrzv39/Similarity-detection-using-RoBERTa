I must confess that the man who jests over sex relations is
to me incomparably lower than the man who sustains clean but wholly illegitimate sex relations;
and while I am conscious of a strong movement of friendship towards a lad who has admitted
impurity in his life but retains reverence for purity, it is hard to feel anything but repulsion
towards one who profanes the subject of sex with coarse and ribald talk.

As a result of the two evils of which I have now spoken, together with the physical effects
of masturbation, young men become powerless to face the sexual temptations of manhood; and
many, who in all other relations of life are admirable, sink in this matter into the mire of
prostitution or the less demoralising, but far crueller, sin of seduction.

Thrown on the streets, usually through no fault of her own, often merely from an over-trustful
love, the prostitute sinks to the lowest depths of degradation and despair. It is not merely
that she sells to every comer, clean or bestial, without even the excuse of appetite or of
passion, what should be yielded alone to love; but it is also that to do this she poisons body
and mind with spirit-drinking, leads a life of demoralising indolence and self-indulgence,
is cut off from all decent associations, and sinks, under the combined influence of these things
and of fell disease, into a loathsome creature whom not the lowest wants; sinks into destitution,
misery, suicide, or the outcast's early grave.

Into the contamination of this inferno, into active support of this cruel infamy, many and
many a young man is led by the impurity of his boyhood. Such at least is the conclusion of
some who know boys best.
