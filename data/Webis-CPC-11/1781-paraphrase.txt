As both wills are thorough in their arrangement of my property, I now give my brother John Smyth, Esq. the sole right to execute my will and, in so doing, I am assured that he will justly make sure my son is cared for.  I also ask that my son transport his mother's remains to Ashton and bury them in the family vault by my side and to erect a tribute in her honor.
