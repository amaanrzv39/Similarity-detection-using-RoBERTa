To them he is little more than a buffoon.To
southern Europe, he is the bold,prompt, shrewd,
 popular ideal, suiting himself by craft to every superior, regarding all things with a shoulder-shrugging, quizzical philosophy; a democratic Mephistopheles; a lurking devil, equalizing himself, and the people with him, by wit and insolence, with nobility itself.

Fast-Day, in Boston, was operatically fÃªted with 'the light and melodious Martha,' by that arch-thief of melodies, Flotow.

A friend suggests that Masaniello for high mass, and Don Giovanni for St. John's day would be a great advance in these dramatic unities.
