The Clerk, tipping his hat said "It is, Sir."

Then Guerande, challenged, "Take off your coat and let's wrestle, best two out of three falls," all the while glaring at Clerk's lover Annaik.  Clerk saw this and replied, "No, I don't want to make you look bad, because you  it wouldn't be right for me to better a man of your stature, after all, your father is a dignitary and mine is a plumber."

Geurande retorted, "What are you talking about, you seem to do well with the ladies and could have your choice of any woman in the city."

Clerk countered, "Sir, I'm sorry but I did not choose Annaik. She was chosen for me by God."

All along, Annaik was visibly shaken because she'd heard the stories of the Marquis of Guerande and knew he was a bad man.
