Going upon Glogau; upon Breslau?" That is a heavy-footed certainty, audibly tramping forward
on us, amid these fond visions of the air! Certain too, and visible to a duller eye than Friedrich's;
Loudon in Silesia is meditating mischief. "The inevitable Russians, the inevitable Loudon;
and nothing but Fouquet and Henri on guard there, with their long thin chain of posts, infinitely
too thin to do any execution!" thinks the King. To whom their modes of operating are but little
satisfactory, as seen at Schlettau from the distance. "Condense yourself," urges he always
on Henri; "go forward on the Russians; attack sharply this Corps, that Corps, while they are
still separate and on march!" Henri did condense himself, "took post between Sagan and Sprottau;
post at Frankfurt,"--poor Frankfurt, is it to have a Kunersdorf or Zorndorf every year, then?
No; the cautious Henri never could see his way into these adventures; and did not attack any
Corps of the Russians. Took post at Landsberg ultimately,--the Russians, as usual, having Posen
as place-of-arms,--and vigilantly watched the Russians, without coming to strokes at all. A
spectacle growing gradually intolerable to the King, though he tries to veil his feelings.

Neither was Fouquet's plan of procedure well seen by Friedrich in the distance. Ever since
that of Regiment Manteuffel, which was a bit of disappointment, Loudon has been quietly industrious
on a bigger scale.
