The names of his publications, the dates of them, the number of them,
the publisher's price for them, the critic's opinion of them, are meagre facts for the biographer;
and if the man of genius be a man of quiet, sequestered life, the record of it will be only
the more uninteresting to the reader. It is only when something painful has been suffered,
something eccentric done and misunderstood and denounced or derided, that the biography rouses
the languid interest of the public.
