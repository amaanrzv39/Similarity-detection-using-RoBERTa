third class of stories for which an Asiatic origin may be claimed, contains those in which figures a monster or devil who cannot be killed until some external object with which his life is mysteriously linked has been destroyed. Such a being occurs sometimes in European folk-tales, in those of the east & north of Europe. The most familiar instance is that of "The Giant who had no Heart in his body" of the "Tales from the Norse." A number of the best specimens of this kind of monster are to be found in the Russian tales about Koshchei the Deathless. But these remarkably abnormal beings seem at home in western folk-lore. They are but small in keeping with their European surroundings, & never seem to divest themselves of their alien air.
