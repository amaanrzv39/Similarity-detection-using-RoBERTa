I had turned twenty the yea that I finally decided to ship out on board the Eliza Ann from Boston bound for Calcutta with Captain Saunders. 

He'd always tell me that going to sea was like a "dog's life," but I liked it anyway and so I set off on my first long voyage as a sailor alongside with him. 

One of our crewmates was Jamie. Captain Saunders told me that Jamie wasn't from around here and that he thought Jamie may be part Scotch though. He said that everybody liked Jamie because he was so smart, that they used to kid around and tell him that he had a mind, "like a steel trap." The Captain also said that Jamie was well liked because he knew alot of songs, but that he just liked him because he did his job so well jumping around the rigging like a bird.

Jamie was leaning back on the foremast, his black hair blowing over his shoulders when one of the passengers, an artist made a sketch of him for a local magazine.

Yeah Jamie's a real liked guy by the passengers, andis co-workers.
