It will be most interesting hereafter to mark the gradual changes already beginning to take
place in this rich, but limited district. It is destined throughout, we may be sure, to very
thorough and systematic exploration. For, although it is true that gold is not to be found
in all parts of it, still it is not unreasonable to search for the precious metal throughout
this whole region, wherever the occurrence of true quartz-veins--the almost sole matrix of
the gold--is shown by boulders on the surface.
