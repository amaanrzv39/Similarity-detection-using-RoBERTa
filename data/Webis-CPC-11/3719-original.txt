The story as told by the authors, however, is one of absorbing interest that thrills the reader
with emotion and depicts the scenes of terror, destruction, misery and suffering as vividly
as if the reader were an eye-witness to all the details of the stupendous disaster.

The history of the Earthquake and Fire Horror is told consecutively and systematically from
beginning to end.

"The Doomed City" is a pen picture of San Francisco while its destruction was impending.

The four days of the conflagration are described each in separate chapters in such a way that
the reader can follow the progress of the fire from the time of the first alarm until it was
conquered by the dynamite squad of heroes.

A great amount of space has been devoted to "Thrilling Personal Experiences" and "Scenes of
Death and Terror," so that the reader has a thousand and one phases of the horror as witnessed
by those who passed through the awful experience of the earthquake shock and the ordeal of
the conflagration.

For purposes of comparison a chapter has been devoted to a magnificent description of San Francisco
before the fire, "The City of a Hundred Hills," the Mecca of sight-seers and pleasure loving
travelers.

The descriptions of the Refuge Camps established in Golden Gate Park, the Presidio and other
open spaces depict the sorrow and the suffering of the stricken people in words that appeal
to the heart.

The magnificent manner in which the whole nation responded with aid and the conduct of the
relief work are told in a way that brings a thrill of pride to every American heart.

"Fighting the Fire with Dynamite" is a thrilling chapter of personal bravery and heroism, and
the work of the "Boys in Blue" who patrolled the city and guarded life and property is adequately
narrated.
