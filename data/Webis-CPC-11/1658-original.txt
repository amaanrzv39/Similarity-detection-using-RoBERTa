The main
body drawn up in a long line remained inactive with the artillery, and a smaller corps as a
rear-guard seemed destined to communicate with the fleet of Lord Cochrane at Cape Kolias. At
the Pir√¶us, about 700 men were scattered about in all the disorder of an Eastern encampment,
without making the slightest attempt to distract the attention of the Turkish troops. The French
General Gueheneuc and the Bavarian General Heideck, both witnessed the battle.
