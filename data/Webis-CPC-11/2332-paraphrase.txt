A few miles upriver from Jamestown, at Falling Creek, the English  constructed their former iron furnace within America within  1620-21. Iron was smelted within the furnace, and a few  instruments were forged--the former iron objects made within the New World via the English. In 1622 the Indians massacred the ironworkers and their households, and spoilt the furnace. Although it was never resurrected, its importance cannot be overstressed, for the Falling Creek spot can rightfully allegation the honor of being the birthplace of the American iron industry.
