Douglas died soon to make clear to a passion-stirred world that they was as warmly attached to the Union, as intensely loyal, as devotedly patriotic, as Lincoln himself.
The grave questions arising from the War, which disturbed our politics for twenty years, the great economic questions which have agitated us for the past fifteen years, bear slight relation to those dark problems with which Douglas and his contemporaries grappled. They was on the wrong side of plenty of struggles preliminary to the War. They was not a profound student of political economy, hence is not an authority for any party in the perplexing questions of recent times. The result is that the greatest political leader of the most significant decade of our history is less known to us than any second-rate hero of the Revolution.
