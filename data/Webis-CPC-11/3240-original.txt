In
the same way, you remark in the common people, an inconceivable idleness up to the very moment
when their activity is roused; then it knows no obstacle, dreads no danger, and seems to triumph
equally over the elements and men.

I had understood that the internal administration, that of war as well as of justice, frequently
fell into the most venal hands, and that by the dilapidations which the subaltern agents allowed
themselves, it was impossible to form any just idea either of the number of troops, or of the
measures taken to provision them; for lying and theft are inseparable, and in a country of
such recent civilization the intermediate class have neither the simplicity of the peasantry,
nor the grandeur of the boyars; and no public opinion yet exists to keep in check this third
class, whose existence is so recent, and which has lost the naivete of popular faith without
having acquired the point of honor. A display of jealous feeling was also remarked between
the military commanders. It is in the very nature of a despotic government to create, even
in spite of itself, jealousy in those who surround it: the will of one man being able to change
entirely the fortune of every individual, fear and hope have too much scope not to be constantly
agitating this jealousy, which is also very much excited by another feeling, the hatred of
foreigners.
