Browning might say, as his wife said in an early preface, "I never mistook pleasure for the
final cause of poetry, nor leisure for the hour of the poet;" as indeed he has himself said,
to much the same effect, in a letter printed many years ago: "I never pretended to offer such
literature as should be a substitute for a cigar or a game at dominoes to an idle man." But
he has not made anything like such a demand on the reader's faculties as people, not readers,
seem to suppose.
