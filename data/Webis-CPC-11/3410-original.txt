They would seize the little sprouts and jerk the seeds up. They came by
battalions. I have seen the fields covered with them. They made a terrible noise when rising
in the air. I have seen the sun darkened by the countless myriads of pigeons coming in the
spring. They would be talking to each other, making ready to build their nests. In the woods,
nothing else could be heard.

We had one wild pair of almost unbroken steers and a yoke of old staid oxen. The only way father
could drive the steers was to tie ropes to their horns and then jump in the wagon and let them
go. They would run for miles. I was always afraid of them. They were apt to stampede and make
trouble in finding them if there was a bad storm. One evening father was away and a bad storm
approached. I took the ropes and told mother I was going to tie the oxen. She begged me not
to, as she feared they would hurt me. I had a scheme--I opened the front gate and as they came
through the partly opened gate, threw the ropes over them and quickly tied them in the barn.
The old oxen, I got in without any trouble. I tied them and went to reach in behind one, to
close the barn door and bolt it. He was scared and kicked out, knocking me with his shod hoof.
I did not get my breath for a long time. The calk of the iron shoe was left sticking in the
barn door.

Some drovers stayed near us with a large drove of cattle in '45 or '46. They were on their
way to the Red River of the north country. We kept the cattle in our yard and used to milk
them. I picked out a cow for Mr. Larpenteur to buy as I had milked them and knew which gave
the richest milk. He put her in a poorly fenced barnyard. She was homesick and bellowed terribly.
