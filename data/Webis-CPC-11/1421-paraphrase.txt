The letter you received was written without my knowledge or delibrate consent.True is that ,frightened by my husband's threats,and in some measure reconciled to the wicked imposition by knowing that, after all ,the right child would be in his right place ,I later lent myself to danby's evil purposes.But above all i feared for my sonwhom I fully trust he would not have scrupled to make away with in revenge for exposing his beneficial fraud.
