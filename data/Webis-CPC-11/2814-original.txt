About four in the afternoon we landed at the Conucos de Siquita, the Indian plantations of
the mission of San Fernando. The good people wished to detain us among them, but we continued
to go up against the current, which ran at the rate of five feet a second, according to a measurement
I made by observing the time that a floating body took to go down a given distance. We entered
the mouth of the Guaviare on a dark night, passed the point where the Rio Atabapo joins the
Guaviare, and arrived at the mission after midnight. We were lodged as usual at the Convent,
that is, in the house of the missionary, who, though much surprised at our unexpected visit,
nevertheless received us with the kindest hospitality.

NOTE.
