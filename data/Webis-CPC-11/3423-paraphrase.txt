They shouted, “'Long live our gracious Margravine!, long live the noble Mandeville!' 

The Count Rudolf of Haggenhausen, who had a countenance as a result of many fights said,  “In truth, I did not believe that we good take back such glorious tidings to our lady and not by Saint Wladimir, a pledge so great.

The Conrad of the  Thirty Mountains cried, that he can never set his lance down, but that the Mafgravine has a good eye, with sinews and thewes there, but they will take order with the infidel scum.  He wondered how they shall have this cavalier order for the battle.  He also added he would gladly fight in his name.

Chopinski agreed but said he must not go in such a way. And added, there on his mule was a suit of Milan armour, which a king might wear on the day of battle for his crown and asked the knaves to bring it and let the Mandeville be clad and betrothed to their mistress.

I said, "'Brave Chopinski,' 'and you, kind sirs and nobles, forgive me if I cannot thank you now as good as you deserve.  But there will be a time, help me arm myself, and we shall challed the prowess of giant of Kalbs-Braten!’

‘I was armored in a moment and mounted on a charging horse, and headed the troops. Their applause were intensified again.’

I said to the warrior of the Thirty Mountains, “Lord Conrod, Slavata has gone there with lances, aiming to cross the mire, and attack us from the rear.  You hold him in check.” 
"'By my father's head!' cried Conrad, ‘This is a very good opportunity.”
