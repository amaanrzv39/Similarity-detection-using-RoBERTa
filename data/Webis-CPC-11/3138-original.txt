Leonardo Bruni, often called Leonardo Aretini from his birthplace Arezzo, translated five of
the dialogues of Plato in addition to the letters.

The first notice of this edition is found in the Catalogue Bolongaro-Crevenna (Amst., 1789),
where it is described as containing 52 printed leaves. It appears from the price-list printed
after the sale in 1790 that it had not been sold, but was "retenu, faute de commissions ou
de concurrence," and was still obtainable at the price of 15 florins. No trace of it has since
been found and Panzer and Hain were able only to copy the catalogue description. Philippe (1885)
described Heynlin's copy, which is preserved in the library of the University of Basel, as
consisting of one first blank leaf, forty-nine printed leaves and two blank leaves at the end.
