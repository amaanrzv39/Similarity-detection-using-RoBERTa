Some days I believe that my past hate of Drane is over because he is actually nice to me.  In fact, Drane actually likes to spend time with me!  However, when I remember he is welcome at your home but I am barred, it makes me angry. You are my future partner in life, my love, but you don't want me near your home?  How can this be? I feel abused.  Did Drane not come to your home yesterday?  

Betty replied, "Sure he came over but it does not matter now."
