In the book STRIKING FOR THE RIGHT by Julia A. Eastman, the writer lovingly and lingeringly creates a character with strange glows and shadows. The characters called Aunt Lesbia, Deacon Harkaway, Tom Dorrance, and the master and mistress of Graythorpe poor-house are genuine "charcoal sketches." Eastman draws Miss Margaret is admirably. In this large 16mo illustrated book costing $175, the story captivates the reader, holding him/her on the edge of his/her seat with excitment and expectancy. Clearly, this book has a civilizing influence on the family.
