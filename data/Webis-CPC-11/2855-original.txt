The latter are reached by means of tall scaffoldings of strong poles of bamboo, often
more than a hundred feet in height. The nests are swept from the rock with a pole terminating
in a small iron spatula, and carrying near the extremity a wax candle; falling to the ground,
which is floored with guano several feet thick, they are gathered up in baskets. The white
nests are gathered three times in the year at intervals of about a month, the black nests usually
only twice; as many as three tons of black nests are sometimes taken from one big cave in the
course of the annual gathering. Each cave, or, in the case of large caves, each natural subdivision
of it, is claimed as the property of some individual, who holds it during his lifetime and
transmits it to his heirs.
