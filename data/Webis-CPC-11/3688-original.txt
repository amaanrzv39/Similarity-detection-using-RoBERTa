Second Sportsman (a stout, jovial man, breaking in). Tickled him up! By gum, I thought I was
going to be tickled up, I tell you. Shot was flying all round me--bang! bang! all over the
place. I loosed off twice at him, and then went down, to avoid punishment. Haven't a notion
what became of him.

Third Sportsman (choking with laughter at the recollection). I saw you go down, old cock. First
go off, I thought you were hit: but, when you got that old face of yours up, and began to holler
"Wor guns!" as if you meant to bust, why I jolly soon knew there wasn't much the matter with
you. Just look at him, you chaps. Do you think an ordinary charge of shot would go through
that? Not likely.

Fourth Sportsman (military man). Gad, it was awful! I'd rather be bucketed about by EVELYN
WOOD for a week than face another woodcock. I heard 'em shoutin', "Woodcock forward! Woodcock
back! Woodcock to the right! Woodcock to the left! Mark--mark!" Gad! thinks I to myself, the
bally place must be full of 'em. Just then out he came, as sly as be blowed. My old bundook
went off of its own accord. I bagged the best part of an oak tree, and, after that, I scooted.
Things were gettin' just a shade too warm, by gad! A reg'lar hail-storm, that's what it was.
No, thank you, thinks I; not for this party--I'm off to cover. So that's all I know about it.
Thanks, TOMMY--do you mind handin' round that beer-jug?

First Sportsman (rallying him). Just think of that. And we're all of us taxed to keep a chap
like that in comfort.
