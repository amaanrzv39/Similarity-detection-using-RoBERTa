Don't make any remarks either in a competition (this, of course, is worst of all) or in an
ordinary bout. Don't argue, except with the sticks. Remember that the beau-ideal swordsman
is one who fights hard, with "silent lips and striking hand."

COMPETITIONS.

Once a man has mastered the rudiments of any game and acquired some considerable amount of
dexterity in "loose play," he begins to long to be pitted against some one else in order to
measure his strength. Before long the limits of his own gymnasium grow too small for his ambition,
and then it is that we may expect to find him looking round for a chance of earning substantial
laurels in public competitions. Unfortunately the stick-player will not find many opportunities
of displaying his skill in public. As far as the present writer knows, there are only two prizes
offered annually in London for single-stick, and neither of these attract much attention. One
of them is given at the Military Tournament at Islington, in June, and one at the German Gymnasium,
in December. The former of these prizes is open only to soldiers, militia-men, or volunteers,
the latter to any member of a respectable athletic club, who is prepared to pay 2s. 6d. for
his entrance fee. The attendance of spectators at both shows is very poor, which is to be regretted,
as the interest of the public in any game generally goes a long way towards insuring improvement
in the play.

It is just as well, before entering for either of these competitions, to know something about
the conditions under which they take place, and the rules which govern them. The bouts are
generally played in a fourteen foot ring, at least that is the statement in the notice to players,
and it is as well to be prepared to confine your movements to such a limited area.
