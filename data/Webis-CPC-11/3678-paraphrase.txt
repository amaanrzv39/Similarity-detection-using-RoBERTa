I knowed the girl mentioned once by her good looks, and the old man of his grumpy-yallow frontispiece. All of a sudden I take note of a Figs coming up from the cuddy, which I did right out of my Master Down, in spite of his wig and a couple o 'high-heeled boots, then gave him the go to guy treading among eggs. When I hear him lisp like the skipper of the round-house if there was any fear of wind, that was all I could do to keep the juice in my cheek. Away he goes up laughing, doing everything, to look over the bulwark behind his girlfriend, givin 'me a glance over his shoulder. At night I see the two holding a sort of a collogue rear wheel, when I was tricking me at the helm. After a while, there was a row arose among the passengers, with the old naboob and the skipper, to find out who it was who held a song every night still in the first guard, next to the ladies' cabin, under the stern deck. It could not be cleared up, hows'ever, who it was. All sorts o 'places they said it comed from - Mizen chains quarter-galleries, the lower deck ports, and davit boats. But what do the old hunks most in a rage was, was the songs every man of them as "Rule Britannia", "Bay of Biscay," "Britannia's bulwarks," and "All in the Downs." The Captain was at sea about it, and none of the men would say something, by all accounts it was the best pipe on a sea-song that should be heard. For my part, I knowed very well what was floating. One night a man comed for'ard from the wheel, after steering his dog pass on, and "Well I'm blessed, fed, says he fok'sle," but the guy behind yonder with his wife - he of the greenest page I've come to come over! What d'ye think I hear him say to old Yallowchops one hour agone? '
