Our author was evidently a man of some poetical fancy, and if not worthy to be classed "among
the chief of English poets," he is at least entitled to a niche in the temple of fame.

My object in calling attention to this long forgotten author is, to gain some information respecting
his manuscript works. According to Wood, they consist of--1. Verses in Description of the chief
Cities of Europe; 2. Chronicle of Queen Elizabeth's reign; 3. Life of William Camden.
