I still have a confused memory of the beginning of storm which raged for days, a sort of ninght mare. When I am on the sea, this day haunt me at intervals. The thing is that during that period is the whie face of my mother, ill in her berth. In the ship there is five hundred emigrants with us, and the storm grew wilder an unreasoning terror filled our felloe passengers.
