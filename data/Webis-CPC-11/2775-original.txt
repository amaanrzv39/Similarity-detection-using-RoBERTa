Ho! evolutionists, ninety-nine
out of every hundred of you, get out! You have no right to speak on the subject; otherwise,
Haeckel is one of the foolish men, and talks without understanding himself. You must be at
home in all those sciences, and emancipate yourselves from all religious beliefs before you
have a right to be heard upon the grave question of evolution from an ancestral moneron; for
you are incapable of comprehending your own monistic--materialistic origin. For, according
to Haeckel, before a man is entitled to be heard he must renounce all faith in God, in the
Bible, in the human spirit, and in the future life. Mr. Haeckel knows a great deal? Well, there
are some very weighty men in this world?
