The use of gloves must be of very high antiquity. In the Middle Ages the priest who celebrated
mass always, I believe, wore them during that ceremony; but it was just the contrary in courts
of justice, where the presiding judge, as well as the criminal, was not allowed to cover his
hands. It was anciently a popular saying, that three kingdoms must contribute to the formation
of a good glove:--Spain to prepare the leather, France to cut them out, and England to sow them.

I think the etymology of the word glove is in far from a satisfactory state. It is a good subject
for some of your learned philological correspondents, to whom I beg leave to recommend its
elucidation.
