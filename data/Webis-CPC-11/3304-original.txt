Dr. Morgan in a work entitled 'The Moral Philosopher, or a Dialogue between Philalethes a Christian
Deist, and Theophanes a Christian Jew,' follows closely in Tindal's footsteps. Like him, he
insists upon the absolute perfection of the law or religion of nature, of which Christianity
is only a republication. Like him, he professes himself a Christian Deist and vigorously protests
against being supposed to be an enemy to Christianity. But his work is inferior to Tindal's
in every respect. It is an ill-written book. It is mainly directed against the Jewish economy.
But Morgan takes a far wider range than this, embracing the whole of the Old Testament, which
he appears to read backward, finding objects of admiration in what are there set before us
as objects of reprobation and vice versa.

But though Morgan deals mainly with the Old Testament, he throws considerable doubt in his
third volume upon the New. The account given of the life of Christ, still more, that of His
Resurrection, and above all, the miracles wrought by His apostles, are all thrown into discredit.[157]

On the whole, this book marks a distinct epoch in the history of English Deism. There is little
indeed said by Morgan which had not been insinuated by one or other of his predecessors, but
the point to be marked is that it was now said, not merely insinuated. The whole tone of the
book indicates 'the beginning of the end' not far distant, that end being what Lechler calls
'the dissolution of Deism into Scepticism.'

But there is yet one more author to be noticed whose works were still written in the earlier
vein of Deism.
