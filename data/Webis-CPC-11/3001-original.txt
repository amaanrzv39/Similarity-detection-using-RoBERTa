That is to say, the laws of water did not
exist until water existed, etc. So it is easy to perceive the truth that the laws of nature
created nothing. Nature is said to be the aggregate of everything; therefore nature created
nothing. The laws of nature, being the rules according to which effects are produced, demonstrate
the existence of a cause or agent which operates. As the rules of navigation never steered
a ship, so the law of gravity never moved a planet. A bare order or law of nature was not the
cause of nature. To confound order or law with cause is to speak unadvisedlyâ€”unintelligently;
it is perfectly irrational. Would you cut off executive authority in a government and continue
its existence without a person or society to exercise, judge and execute according to law?
