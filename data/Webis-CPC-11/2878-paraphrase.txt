We believe those who have stood for her, clearly have taken a dive into consumption as well as frailty, the equal to everything which is pointless and evil, have falsely spoken against her wills and actions. She is in fact, as the rest of us, an ancestor of her previous acts and enviornmental condition. Her knowledge was as great as her distinguishing features. No moral affect was placed upon her from her marriage. A strange and different path was made for her by her seperation, that had never been traveled before with no punishment. However, we do not think, that even in the midst of the worse of her life, that she for one moment lost sight of her goal.We are strongly aware of her purpose for the progress for mankind, her woe for the errors of the race, and her dedicated lack of trust for existing institutions.
