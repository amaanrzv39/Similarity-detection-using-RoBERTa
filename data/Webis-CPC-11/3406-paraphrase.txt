Our cannons were now so over-heated by the incessant fire we kept up, that we were forced to reduce the volleys by nearly one-half, as well as to wait for their cooling before reloading; the men, too, were so fatigued at some guns, that they required the assistance of the others to work them; the uppermost gun on the gangway had only two men left untouched, Between seven and eight o'clock, the fire of the enemy's guns had mesureably diminished, and they were running in droves from the demolished building`s, to the great gate of the city; they were distinctly seen, (in all their movements) by the glow of their burning navy and arsenal. The battery in the upper part of the town, which, was too high to fire upon, kept up  steady fire, and another further to the east was still at work. To bring our broadside to bear upon it, a hawser was run out to the Severn, on our star-board bow, the ship was swung to the proper bearing, and we soon had them. At 45 minutes past nine, the squadron began to move out, some making sail, and others taking advantage of a light breeze off the land, while others were towing and warping: the only sail which we had fit to set, was the main-topmast staysail, and this was of too stout a canvass to feel the breeze; the boats of our own ship were unable to move her, after a kedge anchor, which was run out to the length of the stream-cable, had come home; thus we were left, dependant either on a breeze or the assistance of the squadron. An officer was sent to tell the admiral our situation, but the boat was sunk from under the crew, who were picked up by another; a second boat was more successful, and the admiral ordered all the boats he could collect to our assistance.
