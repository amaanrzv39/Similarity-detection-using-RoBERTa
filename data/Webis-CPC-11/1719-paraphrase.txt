I am not at all fond of drawing rooms, jets of water,of bowers or flower-beds. Instead i like pamphlets, harpsichords, games, knots, stupid witticisms, simpering looks,pretty story tellers and heavy suppers in a bush, barn , a meadow .  When I was passing through a hamlet a sweet smell of parsley omelet tempted me.
