Improvements in the methods of applying electricity, as stated on pages 293 to 296, and
300, 329, and 332, which we have not room to copy.

3d. He has introduced the term Faradaic current to represent the induced current, first discovered
by Professor Henry, and so much extended in application by Faraday.

4th. The determination of several definite points in sentient and mixed nerves, often the seats
of neuralgic pain,--thus correcting Dr. Valleix's painful points.

5th. The treatment of uterine, and some other female disorders, by means of the induced galvanic
current (pages 612 to 621).

A careful examination of this book shows it to contain a very full résumé of the best which
have been written on the subjects embraced under the medical applications of electricity in
its various modes of development, and a careful analysis of the doctrines of others; while
the author has given frankly an account of cases in which he has failed, as of those in which
he has been successful. He does not offer electric treatment as a panacea for "all the ills
which flesh is heir to," but shows how far and in what cases it proves beneficial. He has shown
that there is a right and a wrong way of operating, and that mischief may be done by an unskilful
hand, while one who is well qualified by scientific knowledge and practical experience may
do much good, and in many diseases,--more especially in those of the nerves, such as neuralgia
and partial paralysis, in which remarkable cures have been effected. We commend this work to
the attention of medical gentlemen, and especially to students of medicine who wish to be posted
up in the novel methods of treating diseases. It is also a book which all scientific men may
consult with advantage, and which will gratify the curiosity of the general scholar.
