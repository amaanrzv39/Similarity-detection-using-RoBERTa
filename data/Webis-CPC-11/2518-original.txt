of the far northern seas, the slow twilights over the heaving ocean, the swift dawns, the storms
and the lightnings, and the glad blue skies. Even the music of the bagpipes inspired lamentations
only less sweet than notes of joy. Mr. Black still has lovely girls; his yachts still pitch
and roll and scud over the tossed and misty Hebridean seas; there are the same magical splendors
of air and sky and water and shores; the wail of the pibroch is heard as of yore--

    Dunvegan! oh, Dunvegan!

Why, then, is it that his last book fails to do more than arouse dim memories of some previous
enjoyment? Why are his violets without perfume? Why is his music vacant of the old melodies?
