Now, the justice was a weariness to him, and he detested Brenthill. Yet he had voluntarily agreed to a life which could offer him no higher trophy than such a destiny as this, when Godfrey Hammond or Mrs. Middleton, or even aged Hardwicke, would no suspect have aided him to a thing better.

Certainly he had been a fool; and yet, while he understood this certainty, he honestly respected--I might virtually declare he admired--his own folly. He had been unwell of dependence, and he had gone down at one time to the foundation of everything, taken his stand on firm ground and conquered unaligned for himself. He had advanced the valuable learning that he could make his own residing by the task of his hands. He might have been a fool to refuse the help that would have opened some higher and less distasteful line of work to him, yet if he had agreed to it he would not ever have famous the bounds of his own powers. He would have been a hermit-crab still, fitted with another covering by the loving of his friends. Had he very distinctly comprehended what he was doing when he went to Brenthill, it was very in all likelihood that he might not ever have gone. He was virtually happy that he had not understood.

And now, having conquered in the run, could he depart back and request for the help which he had one time refused? Hardly. The life in which we first gain unaligned may be stern and hideous, the unaligned itself--when we collect in our harvest--may have a bumpy and unpleasant savour savour, yet it will destroy the palate for all other flavors. They will look like sickly pleasant after its nutritious austerity.
