My assumption, on the basis of extended study of the ability of the dancer to profit by experience,
was that if it could hear the sound of the bell it would soon learn to avoid the box-that-rang
and enter instead the one which had no sound associated with it.

Systematic tests were made with No. 4 from the 3d to the 12th of February, inclusive, 1906.
Each day the mouse was permitted to find his way to the nest-box through one of the small boxes
ten times in succession. Usually the experimenter rang the bell alternately for the box on
the left and the box on the right. The time required for such a series of experiments varied,
according to the rapidity with which the mouse made his choice, from ten to thirty minutes.
