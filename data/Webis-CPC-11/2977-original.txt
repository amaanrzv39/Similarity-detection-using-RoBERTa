Electric-Lamp Signal. Incandescent electric lamps appeared in telephony as a considerable element
about 1890. They are better than either form of mechanical visible signals because of three
principal qualities: simplicity and ease of restoring them to normal as compared with drops;
their compactness; and their greater prominence when displayed. Of the latter quality, one
may say that they are more insistent, as they give out light instead of reflecting it, as do
all other visible signals. In its best form, the lamp signal is mounted behind a hemispherical
lens, either slightly clouded or cut in facets. This lens serves to distribute the rays of
light from the lamp, with the result that the signal may be seen from a wide angle with the
axis of the lens, as shown in Fig. 24.
