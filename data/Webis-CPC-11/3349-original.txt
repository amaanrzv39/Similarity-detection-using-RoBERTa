In the South of Scotland a legend, almost word for word the same as the above, is told of an
old castle there, with the exception that, instead of Danes, the old warrior and his sons are
called Pechts. After the slaughter of his sons the old man's eyes are put out, and he is left
to drag on a miserable existence: he lives to an immense old age, and one day, when all the
generation that fought with him have passed away, he hears the young men celebrating the feats
of strength performed by one of their number; the old Pecht asks for the victor, and requests
him to let him feel his wrist; the young man feigns compliance with his request, but places
an iron crow-bar in the old man's hand instead of his wrist; the old Pecht snaps the bar of
iron in two with his fingers, remarking quietly to the astounded spectators, that "it is a
gey bit gristle, and has not much pith in it yet." The story is told in the second volume of
Chambers's Edinburgh Journal, first series, I think; but I have not the volume at hand to refer
to. The similarity between the two legends is curious and interesting.

The following list of words, which do not appear in Mr. Halliwell's Dictionary of Archaic Words,
may form some contribution, however small, to the enlargement of that and of some of our more
comprehensive English dictionaries.
