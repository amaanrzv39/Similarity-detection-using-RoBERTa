Has the religion of Christ been a disturber of the social organization where social rights were properly understood & regarded? or has it set aside the rights & obligations of men in social life where men were enjoying peaceable, happy relations? Does its legitimate influence make men more evil & miserable? An honest answer to these questions will commend the religion of Jesus Christ, & do honor to him as our Lord & Master. The Scriptures have been the means of establishing institutions which have stood for centuries.
