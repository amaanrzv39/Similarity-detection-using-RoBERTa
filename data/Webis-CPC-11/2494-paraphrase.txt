Paralusis of the nerve of sight may occur and the pain is verey great and death may be caused by the abscess extending to the brain.

Treatment- The treatment for either orbital or periorbital abcess is the same as that for abcess occuring in any part of the body-a free opening for the escape of imprisoned pus. As soon as the true naturre of the disease is recognized this should be made soon. Antiseptic injections may be needed afterwards to stimulate healthy granulation and to prevent septic infection of the ocular membranes. For this purpose a saturated solution of boric acid or listerine 1 part to 10 of water may be used. When the fever runs high, Glauber's salt (sulphate of soda) may be given in 4ounce doses once a day.
