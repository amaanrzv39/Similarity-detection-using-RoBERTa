An exciting nobleman like the Duke of Norfolk, he is as on time to speak as of the harp itself: "He was one of those politicians who are never contented; who plot and counterplot incessantly; who are always running their heads fearlessly, to be sure, but indiscreetly, into danger of decapitation." This fine logical power appears throughout the novel. Unfolding the enthusiasm of the Londoners for Henry of Bolingbroke, and their aloofness towards the enslaved King Richard, the historian acutely observes: "Ever thus, from the beginning of the world, have those been insulted who have fallen from a high estate. The multitude follows successful usurpation, but never offers a shield to fallen dignity."
