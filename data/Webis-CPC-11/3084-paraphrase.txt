Then he traveled south and, on the 15th of the same month, met Francis Asbury at Dover, Delaware. At the first meeting, Coke argued for the founding of an institution for higher education, to be under the patronage of the Methodist Church.[25] This was a common idea to Asbury; for, four years previous to this meeting, John Dickins had made the same proposel to him. The earlier idea had fulfilled only a school, on the plan of Wesley's at Knightwood, England, and for that purpose, a subscription had been opened in North Carolina in 1781.[26]

Coke's new suggestion, to have a college, was positively received and, at the famous Christmas Conference at Baltimore in 1784, the Church was formally organized, with Coke and Asbury as Bishops, and the first Methodist College was founded.
