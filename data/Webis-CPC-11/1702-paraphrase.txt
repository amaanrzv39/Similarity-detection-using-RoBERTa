Their was an author who was not classified among the Chief of English poets but should at least be entitled to a niche in the temple of fame.  In calling attetion to this long forgotten author, we can review 1. Verses in Description of the Chief Cities of Europe, 2. Chronicle of Queen Elizabeth's Regin and 3. Life of William Camden.  By reading these works they can validate that he was an author of some poetical fancy and is worthy to be "Amonog the Chief English Poets".
