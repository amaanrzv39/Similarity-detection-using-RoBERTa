Evethough the Bill was drawn  and confirmed with the Declaration It does not place  a successor if Mary, Ann and William all die without sibling. It is the most improbable case as the three will die without posterity.  But really it came into being as William was impotent and Anne also does'nt have a child living. If all who are entitled to the throne are wiped out from earth  at once who can be  the successor?  Ofcourse the bill had a clause that keeps the papists away from the throne.  But the Bill does not point out a particular person as the successor.
