It has been asked, what is meant by "cases arising under the Constitution,"
in contradiction from those "arising under the laws of the United States"? The difference has
been already explained. All the restrictions upon the authority of the State legislatures furnish
examples of it. They are not, for instance, to emit paper money; but the interdiction results
from the Constitution, and will have no connection with any law of the United States. Should
paper money, notwithstanding, be emited, the controversies concerning it would be cases arising
under the Constitution and not the laws of the United States, in the ordinary signification
of the terms. This may serve as a sample of the whole.

It has also been asked, what need of the word "equity".
