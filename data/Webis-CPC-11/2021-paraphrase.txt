How ironic, if you could seen the city, since it was all light and color with all gayety and grace spread all over the place-- and now, the next day, the place is a ruins just like it has been covered with over twenty centuries of solitude and silence.

The place used to be a vast charnel-house, called St. Pierre. The city is located in a coastal area where you could see the blue waters of Caribbean. The city is burn and smoking, where the ruins became the funeral pyre of 30.000 people. nobody survive the catastrophe to tell tale of whats been going on like what happend in Herculaneum, when the world is entering another millenium.
