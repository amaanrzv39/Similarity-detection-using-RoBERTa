CELTIC LANGUAGE .-- The slats fraus in linguistics as a general rule of law, please suggest that instead of using the word Celtic, Gaelic words, Cymbric, Breton, Armorican, Welsh, Irish, & C would be properly assimilated. Celtic mother is lost - they still can be found only in the names of mountains, rivers, and countries and our knowledge of this language is derived from an acquaintance with two main subsidiaries, Welsh and Cymbric (= Kymric). Gaelic language was prompted by the German invasion of Ireland (Erse), and the Highlands of Scotland (Scotland). Language Cymbric first took refuge in Belgium, later known as bangs, and still lives as Welsh and Bas-Breton, who (not Welsh) is closest to the parent in some words in Latin and Italian.

To understand this subject, inducing deep Eichhoff must be studied carefully.

Illustration by Longfellow - "God's Acre" -. Longfellow's beautiful little poem begins:

"I like that ancient Saxon phrase, which calls the burial-ground God's acre."

is undoubtedly familiar to all readers. It may interest some to know that "old Saxon phrase" not yet become current. I read the words "GOTTES Acker," when in Basel last autumn, included the entry in a modern cemetery, just outside the gate of St. Paul in that city.
