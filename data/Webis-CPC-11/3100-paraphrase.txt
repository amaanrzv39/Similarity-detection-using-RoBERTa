Such a remarkable prophecy to be brought forth by the race, in fact, a close description might have been written after the race, this compliments my divination powers greatly. 

Next week, we go to Bibury and Stockbridge, and if this hot weather continues, the club motto should be "Dum vivo Bibere-- or --Half the soda please!. The race I propose my attention to is the Alington Plate, and seeing that I am always thorough, you will see my tip as a result by my being at the seaside?"

Yours truly LADY GAY.

ALINGTON PLATE SELECTION

The storm was continued all night. I tossed and turned on my pillow, and felt sorry for anyone who was unfortunate enough to toss upon the "Billow!"
