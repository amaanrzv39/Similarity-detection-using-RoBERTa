The principal materials of which they are built are limestone, granite, marble & bricks, & terra-cotta of various colours.
The city hall, the post-office & the court-house, standing in a row, & each occupying a separate block along E. Fayette Street in the exact centre of the city, are one of Baltimore's most imposing buildings, & all of them narrowly escaped destruction by the great fire. The city hall, done in 1875, in the Renaissance style, consists of a centre structure of one storeys surmounted by an iron dome 260 ft. high, & five connecting wings of one storeys surmounted by a mansard roof; the entire outer facing is of white Maryland marble. The post-office, done in 1890, is built of Maine granite.
