From the multitude
of these cahiers (or codices), the three estates, that is, the clergy, the nobility, and the
third estate (the people), compiled each a single cahier to serve as the exponent of its grievances
and its demands. When this complex process had been completed and the three residual cahiers
had been given to the king, the States-general, the only representative body of France, was
dissolved.

Thus it should be with our national history.
