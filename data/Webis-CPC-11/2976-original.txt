The arts by which Pope, soon afterwards, contrived to procure to himself a more general and
a higher reputation than perhaps any English Poet ever attained during his life-time, are known
to the judicious. And as well known is it to them, that the undue exertion of those arts is
the cause why Pope has for some time held a rank in literature, to which, if he had not been
seduced by an over-love of immediate popularity, and had confided more in his native genius,
he never could have descended.

[12] Hughes is express upon this subject: in his dedication of Spenser's Works to Lord Somers,
he writes thus.

He bewitched the nation by his melody, and dazzled it by his polished style, and was himself
blinded by his own success.
