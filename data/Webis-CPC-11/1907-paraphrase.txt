The people said truly that God have made this a country of stones, but they forgot that He had clothed the stones with trees of evergreen foliage and a dense undergrowth of shrubs and grass, to guard and hold jointly the thick bed of loam which the fallen leaves enriched from year to year. It was the axes of their fathers that felled the trees, to trade for fuel, and the billhooks of their mothers that hacked away the bushes and grubbed up their very roots to burn on the household cooking hole.
