Nobody recognises the famous
Toogood, which is entirely "Q's" fault, not theirs; and nobody, except a pretty maid who is
to marry his nephew (his own money has made the match possible), seems to worry overmuch (absit
omen!) about returned prisoners of war. He reveals himself to nobody but his villain brother
William (Mr. AYRTON). That fatuous revenue officer, Lomax (Mr. MALLESON), has written a fulsomely
flattering life of him at which his gorge rises.
