Our turn come
to be indignant when the sermon applies the Christian "paradoxes" to industry, commerce, and
international relations.

And it is along these lines that religious teaching can be made absorbingly interesting.  It
all comes round to the old question, "Are we going to apply Christianity to the problems of
modern society or are we not?"  The case against doing so can be found every day in the press,
so here, at any rate, is an issue worth facing, with a presumably infallible authority to support
each side.  The direction of most religious teaching hitherto has been too purely personal;
the exhortation is too obvious and the appeal falls flat.  Politics without religion lacks
foundation; but religion without politics lacks quite half its content.  Christianity is the
leaven, but so also is politics the lump.

Along these lines, we believe, one might get in the middle and lower parts of the school results
analogous to those we have described in the cases of some sixth form boys.  The present writer
used to teach Divinity to a middle form on the Modern Side, and whenever a Gospel happened
to be scheduled, he found ample material to his hand.  It is surprising how little, for all
the sermons they have heard, most boys of sixteen have faced the ideas expressed in the most
hackneyed texts.  "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle...."  "Love your
enemies." "Take no thought for the morrow."  A most mischievous half-truth has got about that
these sayings are not to be taken literally.  Boys have told me that a "rich man" means one
who has grown rich by robbery.  Well, what is robbery?  "La propriété, c'est le vol"?  "Love
your enemies" means, I have been told, "Have no enemies: lead a peaceable life; but if..."
