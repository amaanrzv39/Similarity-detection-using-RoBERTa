IMBERLACH

Take two cups of matzoth flour, one-quarter pound of powdered ginger, mix together with three
eggs. Set this dough aside until it dries. Take one-half pound of honey and three-quarters
pound of sugar and boil until it gets a reddish color. Beat in the ginger and matzoth dough,
mix it with honey, set back on stove, stirring constantly; when the mixture is thick and a
reddish color, place on the board so as to cool; roll and cut in two-inch lengths.
