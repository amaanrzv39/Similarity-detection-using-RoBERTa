The thought of the skillful best eligible to test is still one of the doubts towards Aldus.
In his most fresh article,[72] Professor Merrill
proclaims that Keil's observation[73] on the process of Aldus in the Book's part X already revised by Beroaldus, Catanaeus, and Avantius might securely have been stretched to coat the work of Aldus on the full body of the Letters. He carries to subject Aldus to a new test, the matter for which we ought to Merrill's own experiments. He equals with Aldus's peice of text the manuscript parts of the Bodleian passel, which are evidently a written record from the Parisinus (=|); [74] in them  Budaeus with his own hand (=i) has precised on the influence of th Parisinus itself, according to Merrill, the mistakes of his transcriber.
