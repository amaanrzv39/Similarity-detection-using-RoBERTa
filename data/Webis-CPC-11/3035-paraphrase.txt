Horace Bushnell was a scholar and has written numerous details about metaphysics and theology, but the Bushnell Park in Hartford will probably be by the future generations more to thank you. Of course, the memories will remain forever fragrant green.

I hope that the proposed park can not replace the sanctuary and the sermon, but, as they say, there are  sermons in stones and good in everything.  But the truth is that a walk through the green fields, at any time and light along streams, is preferable to a sick bed or pharmacist medications and dosages.

Each of us, I think, more or less from the blues, politicians, businessmen, clergymen and even.
