I do not thank you, I invite you blessed. Hello dear princess, hey little knot of friends, and tell them that you hope will do well. Soon you will hear me. Be happy and remember me.

Yours,

Richard Wagner

PARIS, June 5 1849

(You received scores, and see some of here and-bye?)

I was your mother, and she gave me uncommon pleasure, it is a healthy woman! I call on them again. She sends best greetings.

Dear friends,

Is nearly four weeks since my wife left me, and I still had the news of her. My pain and depression are very good. I have to earn another home and hearth, otherwise everything is with me. My heart is bigger than my sense. The Bellona I was in close consultation, and we formed the following opinion and resolution derived therefrom: -

In Paris, I can do any good now, my business is to write an opera in Paris, for something I am unfit. This object can be achieved by storm, and if I achieve the most favorable poem in half a year, and performance in a year and a half. Paris, homeless, or - which is the same - peace of heart, can do no work, I must find a new place where I am home and can make up my mind to remain at home. To a place I selected Zurich. I wrote my wife to come there with her younger sister, with remnants of our household goods, so once more be united to me.
