In the first place, it should be borne in mind that a fugitive slave is not a criminal.

A few years ago, it was thought in Massachusetts that the pursuing of slaves was criminal.
I thank God, it is not yet decided that the escaping from slavery is criminal. It is a mere
question of property under this act. This law has recognized certain property in slaves, claimed
in a certain manner, in the free States. It is a mere question of property. The Southern man
has certain property in his slave.
