In my line of work, once i had a chance to interview a man who once held the position of power. In the beginning of the interview he remarks that "the one-man-power really meant all- men's-power." The process of interview is done in a peaceful environment and brought a good impression in me which then mend his impression in my mind. After i gone through with the interview, i read his speech which he give to his people on the previous Sunday in the Descret Newspaper.
