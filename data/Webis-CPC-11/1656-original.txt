From antediluvian times the demons appear to have been attracted by the daughters of men and
to have come frequently up to earth to pay court to them. The only devil who must always remain

The anatomically melancholic Burton also tells of a devil who was in love with a mortal maiden.
Jacques Cazotte tells the story of Beelzebub as a woman in love with an earth-born man.
