A certain Leboeuf, who had been his fellow-prisoner, died at Creil a few days afterward
in consequence of a wound which he had received on the way.

Gen. von Kluck's army arrived at Crépy-en-Valois on the 2d of September, and took four days
to march through. The town was completely sacked under the eyes of the officers. In particular
the jewelers' shops were ransacked.

Thefts of jewelry and body linen were committed in a house in which lodged a General commanding
with some twelve officers of the General Staff. Almost all the safes in Crépy were gutted.

On the 3d of the same month, at Baron, an artist of great talent, Prof. Albéric Magnard, fired
two shots from a revolver on a troop which was entering his property. One soldier was killed
and another wounded. The Germans, who in so many places have committed the worst cruelties
without any motive, here contented themselves with burning the property of their aggressor.
The latter committed suicide to avoid falling into their hands. None the less the commune was
sacked. M. Robert, notary, was robbed of his jewelry, his linen, and of 1,471 bottles of wine,
and forced to open his safe and allow an officer to take 8,300 francs which were locked up
there. In the evening he saw another officer who wore on his finger nine women's rings, and
whose arms were adorned with six bracelets. Two soldiers told him, besides, that they received
a premium of four marks whenever they brought their commanding officers a piece of jewelry.

In this commune, Mme. X., a most respectable young woman, was violated by two soldiers in succession
in the absence of her husband, who is with the colors. One of these two men ransacked a chest
of drawers while his comrade was committing his crime.
