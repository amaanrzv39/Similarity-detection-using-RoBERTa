Gilbert White of Selborne (Vol. viii., p. 244.).--Oriel College, of which Gilbert White was
for more than fifty years a Fellow, some years since offered to have a portrait of him painted
for their hall. An inquiry was then made of all the members of his family; but no portrait
of any description could be found. I have heard my father say that Gilbert White was much pressed
by his brother Thomas (my grandfather) to have his portrait painted, and that he talked of
it; but it was never done.
