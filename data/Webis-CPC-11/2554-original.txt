The latter represent hitherto unknown
stages in the development of Indian dialects and some of them are closely allied to the language
of Aśoka's inscriptions. Another Prâkrit text is the version of the Dharmapada written in Kharoshṭhî
characters and discovered by the Dutreuil de Rhins mission near Khotan[460], and numerous official
documents in this language and alphabet have been brought home by Stein from the same region.
It is probable that they are approximately coeval with the Kushan dynasty in India and the
use of an Indian vernacular as well as of Sanskrit in Central Asia shows that the connection
between the two countries was not due merely to the introduction of Buddhism.
