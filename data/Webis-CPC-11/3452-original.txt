Now Mr. William Sidney, the younger brother, having five children, between whom his fortune
was divided, these cousins had each just one- fifth of Charles's expectations, and, of course,
Mrs. William Sidney was obliged to limit many of their present indulgences in due proportion
to her income.

And yet I need scarcely tell you that William, the eldest son, who was about the same age as
Charles, and his younger brothers and sisters, were a thousand times happier than their cousin;
and, even with their limited means, did more good to others in a month than Charles did in a year.

In the first place, they were kind and generous to each other.  A book, a toy, any source of
gratification that was opened to one, was always made the property of the whole family; so
that a present or kindness to one of these children, was like bestowing it on five.  Then the
little girls, Fanny and Lucy, were so clever and industrious, that they would make clothes
for the poor, either by purchasing coarse but warm materials with their own money, or from
cast off frocks of their own, which their mamma gave them permission so to employ.  Like all
those who think more of other persons than themselves, and who are constantly enjoying the
pleasure of doing good, they were light-hearted and happy; while their cousin Charles, who
thought of nothing but his own selfish interests, was three days out of the four in bad spirits
and bad temper.

"How I should like to rummage out that closet," said William one day to his cousin, when he
had chanced to have a peep into his receptacle for what he had hoarded.

"Would you, indeed," replied Charles, "I can tell you there is nothing there which would be
of the least use to you."
