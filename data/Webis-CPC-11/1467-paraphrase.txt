A single incident, illustrating this trait in her character, is significance relating:--She went out early one morning to visit a neighbor, promising to be at home to dinner. The neighbor being absent, she requested to be shown into the library. There she became so absorbed in her book, standing, with her bonnet unresolved, that the darkness of the coming night first remind her she had forgotten her meals, and expended the entire day in reading. 
She was peculiarly susceptible to music.
