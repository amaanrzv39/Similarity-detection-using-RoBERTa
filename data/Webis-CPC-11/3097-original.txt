CONVERSION OF PETER BAYSSIERE IN A LETTER TO HIS CHILDREN.[4]

[Footnote 4: This Narrative was originally entitled, "A letter to my children, on the subject
of my conversion from the Romish church, in which I was born, to the Protestant, in which I
hope to die. By Peter Bayssiére, Montaigut, Department Tarn and Garonne." (France.) "As much
of the interest of this Narrative," says the preface to the London edition, "depends upon its
authenticity, the reader is referred to the subjoined extract of a letter from the Rev. Francis
Cunningham, Rector of Pakefield, dated May 20, 1829, which will probably remove any doubts
on the subject.

"......The autograph of Bayssiére's letter I saw when I was in the South of France, in the
year 1826.
