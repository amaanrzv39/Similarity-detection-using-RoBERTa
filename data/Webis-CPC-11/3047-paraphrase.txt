If not erradicated, mildew will cause a plant's leaves to die off. Mildew can be indentified as a white powdery covering over the surface of the leaves, which at this point have withered. It is more obvious on Rose leaves. It is crucial that it be treated immeadiately when this is discovered. It is possible to stop and control the mildew if the appropriate action is taken. The best cure is applying a spray of a mixture of hot water, Flowers of Sulphur, and Quick-lime shaken together. This is a tested and trusted treatment in the war against mildew by florists and gardeners alike.
