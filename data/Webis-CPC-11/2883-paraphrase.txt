Priest Hugh Folliott also left adorns and books. Another priest, R de Maidstone. although "vir magnae literaturae, et in scholastic nominatissimus," only seems to have given the cathedral two responsives, some psalters, and a folklore. Priest Charleton (1369) left a Holy Scripture, a consonant, a lexicon, Nicholas de Lyra, and five Books of Moses, all to be restrained in the chapel. Very tersely afterwards we heard of modification, for 1395 Walter of Ramsbury gave L 10 for making the desks. Probably a book-room, which was over the west cloister, was then put up. A long interval elapsed, during which little seems to have been done for the library. But between c. 1516-35 Bishop Booth and Dean Frowcester left many fine volumes.
