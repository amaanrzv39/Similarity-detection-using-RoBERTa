Although the Thersites dwell and the righteous fall,and usually are not honoured. Captain Campbell being one of our benefactors, hopefully his manes will be thoughtful to our dismay, and his nationality and family allow us to interact with their just problem, this small grain of respect,in which our effort as to the extent lies within our ability to give the holy debt of thankfulness.

With the experienced losses in which the expedition has seen, it is a scare that our great companion we must accept, the Naturalist Kummer; however, with no true proof of his demise has been shown of his fate, his many friends, all experiencing fear, still retain hope of his life. Hopefully they will not be let down.
