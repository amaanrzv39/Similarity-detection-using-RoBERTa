This fact largely accounts for the extreme importance attached by them to marriage alliances, those between members of royal houses.[16] These unions gave to the princess the office of mediatrix; in Beowulf he is called Freothowebbe, "the peace-weaver."[17] From this rose the high position held by queens. Their signatures appear in acts of foundation, decrees of councils, charters, etc. Sometimes they reigned with full royal authority, as did Seaxburg, Queen of the West Saxons, after the death of her husband.[18] From the outset of Christianity in England, the women, and these royal women, were as active and persevering in furthering the Faith, as their men.
