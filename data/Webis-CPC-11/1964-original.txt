Toward the close of the year 1769 Junius sent forth his celebrated letter to the King, for
the publication of which criminal informations were laid against Woodfall, as well as against
Almon and Miller, who immediately reprinted the libel. "Rex v. Almon" was the first case brought
to trial, and the jury found a general verdict of guilty. The defense set up in the trial against
Woodfall was, that the letter was not libellous. The part which Lord Mansfield took is well
known.
