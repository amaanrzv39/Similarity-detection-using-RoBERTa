Let's say there is an object on the table that you can see and touch.  If you take that object away, you can no longer see it nor touch it.  If you put it back again, you can once again see it and touch it. It happens every time.  There must be a connection between the object of sight and the object of touch.  Therefore there must be an unbreakable link between the two senses.  Seeing the object and touching the object, although the experience originates from two quite different senses, we evidence that they are not separate objects, but one.

By using our sense of touch, we have verified the sense of sight without using our eyes, and we learned to do this before we knew of our eyes.
