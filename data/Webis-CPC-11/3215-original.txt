One,
he said, was a Skye, and the other a Yorkshire, terrier. Little Skye was tired and sleepy,
and showed just the tip of his nose and one ear above the pocket; but little Yorkshire was
perfectly wild with fun. He had on a small brown blanket, bound with scarlet braid, which his
master said was his new Ulster coat.

He began his pranks by putting his nose in Charley's pockets, looking for a shilling. Not finding
one, the gentleman sent him into his own coat pocket, whence, after burrowing and tugging for
a while, out he came, with a coin between his teeth, which he held tight and would not give
up. His master said that when the dog found a piece of money he went alone to the cake shop,
and the baker would give him a cake, which he would run home with and eat up immediately, being
particularly fond of sweets.
