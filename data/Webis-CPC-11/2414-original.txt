The monastery is again mentioned in the same work in the account of the
reign of a later king Vaṭṭâgâmini, cir. 38-10 B.C. It is related that Vaṭṭâgâmini being offended
by the inhabitants, caused it to be destroyed after it had existed during the reigns of twenty
one kings, and erected a Buddhist Saṅghârâma in its place. The latter piece of information
is found also in the Dîpavan̄sa of more than a century earlier. [Footnote: Turnour, Mahâvaṅsa,
