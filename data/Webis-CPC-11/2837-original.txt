At least ten times did he let me
approach him within a couple of hundred yards, without for that being a bit nearer getting
hold of him. It was certainly high time to desist from such a mad chase, but I never dreamed
of doing so; and indeed the longer it lasted, the more obstinate I got. I rode on after the
beast, who kept letting me come nearer and nearer, and then darted off again with his loud-laughing
neigh. It was this infernal neigh that made me so savage--there was something so spiteful and
triumphant in it, as though the animal knew he was making a fool of me, and exulted in so doing.
At last, however, I got so sick of my horse-hunt that I determined to make a last trial, and,
if that failed, to turn back.
