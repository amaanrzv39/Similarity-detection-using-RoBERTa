Toward the end of 1769 the celebrated letter of Junius was sent forth to the King, for the publication of which criminal informations were laid against Woodfall, and also against Almon and Miller. The libel was immediately reprinted. 
The first case brought to trial was "Rex v. Almon", for which the jury found a verdict of guilty. The defense in this trial was that the letter was not libellous. Everyone know the part which was taken by Lord Mansfield.
