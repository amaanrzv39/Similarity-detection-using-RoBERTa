Occasionally, but very rarely, she has
    had dreams of riding accompanied by pleasurable sexual emotions
    (she cannot recall any actual experience to suggest this, though
    fond of riding). She has never had any kind of sexual dreams
    about a man; of late years she has occasionally had erotic dreams
    about women.

    Her feeling toward men is friendly, but she has never had sexual
    attraction toward a man. She likes them as good comrades, as men
    like each other.
