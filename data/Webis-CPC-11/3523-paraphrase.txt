"Come on, Remane, how come, for example?"

"If I were you, I'd try not to start out on the wrong foot."

Neither of them said anything else. A tense quiet descended. During this quiet, and kind of pathetically, the black man tugged them upwards on the shore. The four travelers were standing a little while on top of the warm, bleached beach, attracted to one another, figuratively, before they were metaphorically repulsed, by an unwitting groping at commonality. Remane too touched his hat. Dr. Dare was asked by Dr. Frank if she could be helped by him in any way. But Dr. Dare gratefully, with a stiff wave of her pale hand, said, "Farewell."

This may have been the first instant when her gender had been a bother to her during this mission. She would have been perfectly happy apearing before the Relief Committee of Calhoun, with only men as companions, men she didn't have any power over. She strode forward by herself, in a slate dress and a eggshell straw hat, more than capable of carrying her own bags.

The quiet traveler fell behind with the black boat captain. They walked together, ploddingly approaching the others.

A few minutes passed. He moved forward and joined the lady, nervously, starting to say:

"Can I beg your pardon--"

"Oh," Dr. Dare broke in genially, "it's you again."

"Could you please enlighten me as to the preferred manner of becoming a fever nurse here? I want the preferred way, so that I may obtain real employment."

"Certainly, certainly," Dr. Dare agreed, bobbing her head. "I rather thought you'd want to."

"I traveled from the North to do this, but I had intended to journey instead to Savannah."

"So I'd gathered."
