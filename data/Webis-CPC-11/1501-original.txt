I should not forget to mention
that there is a cavern within the basin of the lake, the air of which is so stifling and noxious,
that animals die if forced to remain in it, and lights are extinguished by the gas--phenomena
precisely similar to those of the well-known Grotto del Cane, near Naples.

While I am on the subject of volcanic phenomena, I may as well add a word on the origin of
the trass or tufa, which is so thickly spread over this country.
