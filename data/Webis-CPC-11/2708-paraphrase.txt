MORE CORRECTIVE

Deceased JAMES PAYN, who is well know as waged a ruthless battle against fraud regard in prose, happened one day to listen me quote that terrific lad,
SIBRANDUS SCHAFNABURGENSIS. 

Mr. PAYN noticed smartly:--

"It would price him some perturb to find one. 
I have never searched a passably section of RABELAIS in my existence, and what's more I mean to say so some day and observe the faces."

Well, Mr. PAYN assumed in expressing his own perception honestly. No qualm the needfulness of searching a versification for "Chablis" had something to do with the debut of 'RABELAIS' name at the termination of that line.

I dont much guard whether I have recited precisely or not.
