But
to destroye all without consyderacyon, is and wyll be unto Englande for ever, a most horryble
infamy amonge the grave senyours of other nacyons. A great nombre of them whych purchased these
superstycyouse mansyons reserved of those lybrary bokes, some to serve theyr jakes, some to
scoure theyr candlestycks, and some to rubbe theyr bootes. Some they sold to the grossers and
sopesellers, and some they sent over see to the bokebynders, not in small nombre, but at tymes
whole shyppes full, to the wonderynge of the foren nacyons.
