THERE ARE FEWER CHILDREN, BUT THEY ARE STRONGER (the year 1920).

THESE CHILDREN, WITH THEIR ORIGINALITY AND ESOTERIC TENDENCIES WILL BRING ON A REVOLUTION ON YOUR PLANET THAT WILL END BY DESTROYING YOUR THREADBARE DOGMATISM. This tendency is evidenced via the modern failure of the Interchurch movement. It has been the mannerism onto your planet that you cannot conduct anything without elevating huge sums of money.

It is not finance that does the actual profession but rather PERSONAL SERVICE.
