While relaxed in an oversized red velvet arm chair, young Raoul Chamblard spoke in this fashion. Inside one of the parlor-cars of the express to Marseilles on March 26,1892 this took place. The express had left at 8:50 that morning heading for Paris. Now it was five past nine. The train was crossing over the Charentin Bridge with a rickety rackety sound. Yound Chamblard was conversing with his friend, Maurice Revoille, who was on his way to join his regiment in Algeria, following a six weeks' leave.

With a slight motion the lieutenant of light calvary answered his friend's question. Raoul Chamblard said:

"It is the fixed idea of my father. Chamblards surely must be after me. I am papa's only son, it is my responsibiity to him to do what needs to be done."
