My assumption, on the foundation of broadened study of the skills of the dancing someone to yield by understanding, was that if it could learn the sound of the gong it would before long study to avert the box-that-rang and move into alternatively the one which had no sound linked with it.

Systematic investigates were made with No. 4 from the 3d to the 12th of February, inclusive, 1906. Each day the mouse was sanctioned to find his way to the nest-box through one of the tiny packing containers 10 times in succession. Usually the experimenter rang the gong alternately for the packing box on the left and the packing box on the right. The time demanded for such a succession of tests mixed, as showed by the rapidity with which the mouse made his option, from 10 to 30 minutes.
