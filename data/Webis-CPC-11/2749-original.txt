An old settler who came with his
family told me "Our whole outfit comprised a feather bed and a lunch basket in which were a
knife, fork and two small china dishes. I also bought a single mattress and a pair of blankets
in Cleveland on my way to Duluth. We built our bedsteads out of green tamarack poles peeled,
using the bark for ropes to hold it together and made a table of two boards which were found
floating in the Bay. Bed clothing consisted of Indian blankets and moccasins answered for shoes,
while curtains, carpets and upholstered furniture were unknown."

The postoffice was in a small building on First Street and First Avenue East. The postmaster,
Mr. Richard Marvin was a member of the Fire Brigade.
