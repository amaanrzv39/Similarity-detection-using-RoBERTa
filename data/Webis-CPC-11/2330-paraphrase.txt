The English made the fist American iron furnace a few miles from Jamestown at Falling Creek in 1620 - 1621.  They forged several tools and made the first New World forged items.  But in 1622 the workers there were slaughtered by the native Americans, who destroyed the furnace.  Now the Falling Creek area claims rightfully to be the place where the iron industry was born in America, even though it was never rebuilt after the destruction.
