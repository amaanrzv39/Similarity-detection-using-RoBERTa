The writer Stowe, H.B., is most famous for her detailed and truthful descriptions of her character's true nature.  When she plans a story, however, she is not so accurate, taking no steps to pace and measure her words and the actions of her players.  In spite of the drawbacks of her hurried and imperfect plots, the reader is glued to the story, unable to put it down, and in the end her attempts are appreciated.
