By the 25th most of the company had convened on the west bank of the Big Black River, near the train tracks. Tomorrow they'd need cars for Vicksburg.

The regiment was required now to report at St. Louis, and as planned, on the 26th, they set off from Vicksburg on the steamboat Missouri for their predetermined destination. After arriving on the 31t, they were commanded to march on to Fort Snelling, and on August 1st they boarded the steamboat Brilliant for St. Paul.  Private W. Smith's lifeless body was discovered on the deck two days later, and he was left in Burlington, Iowa, for a proper burial. On the 7th they arrived, and were politely greeted by the locals.  After being received, they continued on to Fort Snelling.
