Miss Mary F. Robinson, whatever distinction may pertain to her verse, should
never have attempted a biography of Emily Bronte.  Her book is mainly of significance because,
appearing in a series of Eminent Women, it served to emphasise the growing opinion that Emily,
as well as Charlotte, had a place among the great writers of her day.  Miss Robinson added
nothing to our knowledge of Emily Bronte, and her book devoted inordinate space to the shortcomings
of Branwell, concerning which she had no new information.

Mr. Leyland's book is professedly a biography of Branwell, and is, indeed, a valuable storehouse
of facts.  It might have had more success had it been written with greater brightness and verve.
As it stands, it is a dull book, readable only by the Bronte enthusiast.
