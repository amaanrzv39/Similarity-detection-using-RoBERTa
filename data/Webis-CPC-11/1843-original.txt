"Sincere attachment and perfect obedience, the strictest
  loyalty we are enjoined to evince towards the Government
  of the country in which we live, and this is a truth, my
  brethren rightly aver, prominently taught in our sacred
  writings. Therefore, in the first place, we look upon the
  monarch, though of another faith and nation, as the
  anointed of the Lord (Isaiah ch. xlv., v. 1), and consider
  his Government as a resplendence of the heavenly
  Government ('Tract Berakhot,' p. 58).
