What if, seconds hence
  When I am very old, yon shimmering doom
  Comes drawing down and down, till all things end?"
  Then with a wizen smirk he proudly felt
  No other mote of God had ever gained
  Such giant grasp of universal truth.

  One was a transcendental monad; thin
  And long and slim of mind; and thus he mused:
  "Oh, vast, unfathomable monad-souls!
  Made in the image"--a hoarse frog croaks from the pool,
  "Hark! 'twas some god, voicing his glorious thought
  In thunder music. Yea, we hear their voice,
  And we may guess their minds from ours, their work.
  Some taste they have like ours, some tendency
  To wriggle about, and munch a trace of scum."
  He floated up on a pin-point bubble of gas
  That burst, pricked by the air, and he was gone.
