Which is exactly like a man, of course.

Men overdo etiquette sometimes, because of a conventional fear of slipping up somewhere. There
was a nice Red Cross major in France who had had no instruction in military matters, and had
no arrogance whatever. So he used to salute all the privates and the M. P.'s before they had
a chance. He was usually asking the road to somewhere or other, and they would stand staring
after him thoughtfully until he was quite out of sight.
