April 26.--Was made an Oddfellow to-day. Initiation didn't last long. CHORKLE and JERRAM were begun with me, and we all had to make dialogues later, resolving our devotion to the many source of Oddfellowship. Afterwards sentiments were called for. The only one I consider was bestowed by a man called TABSEY, a tailor, who looks like to be rather renowned for this kind of thing. After keeping his hand to his head for some time, and sewing his brows, he clarified his throat, and said, in a high size voice,--"May the split of accurate compassion crystallise as it falls, and be shabby as a radiant jewel upon the index finger of affliction." This was vociferously applauded. I complimented TABSEY later, and paid him a admire about it.
