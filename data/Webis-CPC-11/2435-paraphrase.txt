Calzabigi welcomed his return in 1767, when he wrote the manuscript for "Alceste", his latest Libretto. Produced at the Vienna Opera House that year, it became much more successful then even "Orpheus". It follows the tragic and depressing tale of Euriphides through severe and heart-wrenching music. Already the idea that the music of tomorrow had been created, and it suggested that only if the future were forgetful, only then would the piece find acceptance.
