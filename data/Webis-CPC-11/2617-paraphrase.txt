This may be shown to be relevant by observation alone, the noise always ceases when an insect lands on any object.  The sirene has been well applied for the purpose of knowing the rate at which the wings of the insect flap.  The instrument are tuned with the sound of the insect, the vibration.  Using this method it has been shown that the wings of a gnat flap at a rate of 15,000 hz.  The frequency of the note made by the insect while flying is more than two octaves above the highest not of a seven-octave pianoforte.
