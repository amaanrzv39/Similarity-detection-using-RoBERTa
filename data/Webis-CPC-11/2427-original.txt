The prevailing fashion of certain orators interlarding their speeches with frequent classical
quotations, reminds us of a piece of mischievous waggery perpetrated by one of the greatest
men of his time. Sheridan once electrified the country gentlemen in the House of Commons, by
concluding an animated appeal to their patriotism, with a quotation from Herodotus, which they
cheered most vociferously; when, in fact, he merely strung together a jumble of words, a jargon
uttered on the instant, which sounded very much like Greek.
