Later on, again in response to our prayers, we got railways; skilled men and much capital from
foreign countries, first to prospect for gold and then to develop and exploit the mines. Their
labour and hard-earned money were risked when the return was still problematic. Shall we begrudge
them their successes now, seeing that our whole land is equally enriched at the same time,
and but for them and their enterprise the gold would still be lying uselessly hidden in the
depths of the ground? There are now, in 1890, over 100,000 such strangers in the land, and
probably over 200 millions capital invested. Shall they be treated in a manner to justify the
accusation that they were inveigled into our land with the object of despoiling them afterwards
after the style of 'Come into my parlour, says the spider to the fly'? These people count upon
our honest friendship, especially the many English among them who ground that confidence upon
the honourable peace accorded us in 1881. Shall we deceive them? May we hate them for old questions
which that peace was intended to bury for ever? Think of the Lord's dealings with our people--poor,
wandering, and despised at first. He had blessings in store for the tried voortrekkers and
their children. 'The beggar was raised from the dunghill [asch-hoop, i.e., ash-heap, was the
word he used] to sit with princes'--'a table laid for us in the sight of our enemies.' All
this is literally fulfilled. Our President and others representing us have been to Europe and
sat with princes, and we have a country full of riches enough to make any enemy to rage with
jealousy at the sight. Who else but the devil is that enemy? It is he who persecuted our Dutch
and Huguenot ancestors for their faith, and is pursuing us since.
