It is the work of the police to do that." That is not true.
It is not the work of the police to discover anything, nor to initiate proceedings for anybody.
They are a brave good body of men; but they have their set work to do, and their strict rules
for doing it. But, were it so, when you stand before the judgment throne of Him whose will,
Jesus says, is that not one little one should either suffer from hunger, or nakedness, or be
sick and perish, will you dare to tell Him that you knew that that was His will, but that you
left it to the police?

The new law has been created by Christian labour. It is the expression of Christian sentiment.
It must be enforced by Christian money.

To enforce the splendid new law, the Society is seeking to raise its income to £15,000 a year.
In the enforcement of the Factory Acts £30,000 a year is spent. In the enforcement of the Act
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals £29,000 is annually spent. Is it too much to ask for
half these sums for the enforcement of the law for Children, when, without it, their sufferings
must continue? Contributions may be sent to JOHN FAULKNER (Secretary), 7 Harpur Street, Bloomsbury,
London, W.C.
