There are two types of musicians.The aim of one group is to give truthful expression to the music of a good writer. The motive of the other players is entirely different.Their music is of a showy character,brilliant and little thought in it. The difference between the two is truth and vanity.   
    What we have discovered is, we must work for the best, truthful music and not for the vain music.
