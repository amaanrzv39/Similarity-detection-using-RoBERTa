The boy, I suppose, thought that he had all my loop-holes since he had carried away my wonderful bag with him. Under this impression, he had vanished and left a message for me that I should not search for him. I was, however, not ready to accept this suggestion. Also that he had given a hint that "something" may happen at Monte Carlo. What I guessed of the "something" was that this boy would meet his sister at Hotel de Paris on the night following our arrival there. In case the Princess was going to Monte Carlo the Fairy Prince would also be there. I, therefore, did not see any reason why I should not be there even if Molly and Jack did something disastrous to me in their motor.
