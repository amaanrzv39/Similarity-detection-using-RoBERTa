     CRIM MCDERMOTT AND PLUMMER."

Immediately on receipt of the telegram Colonel Deitsch detailed Detectives Witte, Bulmer and
Jackson to look after Jackson. It was learned that he roomed at the house of Mrs. McNevin,
at 222 West Ninth, next door to Robinson's Opera House. Detective Jackson was stationed in
the house and Witte and Bulmer in the saloon opposite.

Just when it seemed as though their intended game had discovered the fact that the officers
were after him and had left for parts unknown he was captured.

It was after nine o'clock, when almost the last ray of hope had died out of the officers breasts,
that Chief of Police Deitsch received word that Jackson had just been seen at the Palace Hotel.
The chief started out and ran into a man answering Jackson's description. He informed the detectives
of the fact, the fellow was watched and was seen to walk slowly down Ninth Street, and on reaching
222 he looked up at the windows. He strolled slowly to Plum Street and stopped and again looked
back at the house.

He then walked rapidly north on Plum Street toward Court. When he had traversed part of the
square Detective Bulmer stepped up to him, saying: "Your name is Jackson, isn't it?"

The man turned perfectly livid and trembled like an aspen, and as the detective continued to
say, "I want you," he exclaimed, "My God! what is this for?"

At the same time the start was made for the Mayor's Office.
