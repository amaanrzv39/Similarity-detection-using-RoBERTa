What the firmness of
just men in times of tyranny, or of tumult, has to do with Juno's oration about Troy it is
hardly possible to conceive. Then, again, how strangely the fight between the Gods and the
Giants is tacked on to the fine hymn to the Muses in that noble ode, "Descende coelo et die
age tibia"! This always struck me as a great fault, and an inexplicable one; for it is peculiarly
alien from the calm good sense, and good taste, which distinguish Horace.

My explanation of it is this. The Odes of Pindar were the acknowledged models of lyric poetry.
Lyric poets imitated his manner as closely as they could; and nothing was more remarkable in
his compositions than the extreme violence and abruptness of the transitions.
