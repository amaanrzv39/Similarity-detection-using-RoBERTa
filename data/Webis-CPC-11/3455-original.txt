The "keeping-room" of Mr. Simeon Brown's house was an intermediate apartment between the ineffable
glories of the front-parlor and that court of the gentiles, the kitchen; for the presence of
a large train of negro servants made the latter apartment an altogether different institution

On one side of the room stood a heavy mahogany sideboard, covered with decanters, labelled
Gin, Brandy, Rum, etc.,--for Simeon was held to be a provider of none but the best, in his

the fireplace was flanked by two broad arm-chairs, covered with stamped leather.

"our views appear to be making a noise in the world.
