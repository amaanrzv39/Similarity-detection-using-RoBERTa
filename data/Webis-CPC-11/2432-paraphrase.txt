The Catalogue of Books in the British Museum which was printed in the XVth Century has been annoted by Mr. Alfred W. Pollard, M.A.  Mr. Pollard is the Hon. Secretary of the Bibliographical Society and an authority on printed books from this ear.  He notes several of the incunabula are imperfect.  He also ednited the list on incunabula.  We greatly appreciate Mr. Pollard's chronological annoted list which also gives name of the printer and the place of printing.
