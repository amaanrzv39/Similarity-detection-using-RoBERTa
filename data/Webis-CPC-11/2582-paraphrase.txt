Extend the forefingers and thumbs.  Then, extend them.  Almost close the other fingers.  With the backs outwards, put the hands above and slightly in front of the ears, around four inches from the head.  Shake them back and forth several times, to make the Arapaho sign. (Dakota I, II, IV.)

Close the right hand.  The end of the index should be in like a hook, and the thumb should be extended (see Fig. 234).  Wave the hand back and forth quickly in a short distance opposite the temple.  (Hidatsa I; Arikara I.) "Represents the pronged horn of the animal.  This is th sign ordinarily used, but it was noticed that in conversing with one of the Dakotas the sign of the latter (Dakota VI) was used several times, to be more readily understood."
