Calm in
mood, dignified, and often majestic in conception, learned beyond all others in his craft,
he mingled thought, feeling, color, brush-work into one grand and glowing whole. He emphasized
nothing, yet elevated everything. In pure intellectual thought he was not so strong as Raphael.
He never sought to make painting a vehicle for theological, literary, or classical ideas. His
tale was largely of humanity under a religious or classical name, but a noble, majestic humanity.
In his art dignified senators, stern doges, and solemn ecclesiastics mingle with open-eyed
madonnas, winning Ariadnes, and youthful Bacchuses. Men and women they are truly, but the very
noblest of the Italian race, the mountain race of the Cadore country--proud, active, glowing
with life; the sea race of Venice--worldly wise, full of character, luxurious in power.

In himself he was an epitome of all the excellences of painting. He was everything, the sum
of Venetian skill, the crowning genius of Renaissance art. He had force, power, invention,
imagination, point of view; he had the infinite knowledge of nature and the infinite mastery
of art. In addition, Fortune smiled upon him as upon a favorite child. Trained in mind and
hand he lived for ninety-nine years and worked unceasingly up to a few months of his death.
His genius was great and his accomplishment equally so. He was celebrated and independent at
thirty-five, though before that he showed something of the influence of Giorgione.
