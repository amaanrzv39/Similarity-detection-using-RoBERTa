As we progress we come to know more about the human condition so that we can quantify the behaviors that are socially acceptable.  We will consider both the innate factors as well as the byproducts of our environment with equal importance.  We embrace these byproducts to the extent that we  do not differentiate between the weak and the strong, the productive and the unproductive, even though the subject has reared its ugly head on previous occasions.  The innate factors, according to Galton, demands we limit the number of individuals allowed to exist and only the most productive shall be granted dispensation.
