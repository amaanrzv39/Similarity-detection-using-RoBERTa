We can only produce water by the ratio of one to eight by hydrogen and oxygen and from no other. when water is decomposed by electric current the proportion, volumes, is as fixed as in the case of weights. Two volumes of hydrogen and one of oxygen go the formation of water. As the Pythagorean system, number and harmony are everywhere dominant in under-world.
