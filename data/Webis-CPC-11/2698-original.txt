Oh that wonderful people! There
is not one art, not one science, about which we may not use the same expression which Lucretius
has employed about the victory over superstition, "Primum Graius homo--."

I think myself very fortunate in having been able to return to these great masters while still
in the full vigour of life, and when my taste and judgment are mature. Most people read all
the Greek that they ever read before they are five and twenty. They never find time for such
studies afterwards till they are in the decline of life; and then their knowledge of the language
is in a great measure lost, and cannot easily be recovered. Accordingly, almost all the ideas
that people have of Greek literature, are ideas formed while they were still very young.
