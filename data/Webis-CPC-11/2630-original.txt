Now the writings of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the rest of the prophets are also miracles,
for although these men wrote at widely different times, and hundreds of years before the birth
of Christ, yet their books all speak of Him.  The light of God's Spirit shone into their hearts
so that they foresaw and foretold the coming of the Saviour King.

Terrible troubles would overwhelm the Jews; but, even though the wall of Jerusalem should be
broken down, the city laid waste, and the inhabitants led away captive, God's words were sure.
He would visit His people at last.  He would redeem them from their sins.

The troubles came, the prophets' eyes streamed with tears, and their hearts were torn with
grief as they saw their land wasted by the heathen.
