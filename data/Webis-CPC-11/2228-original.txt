And he may have had one in Jonson;
at least he thought he had. He cited Dryden and Dorset as collectors and readers of ballads;
and he might have cited others. He found comfort in the fact that Moli√®re's Misanthrope was
on his side. The modern or broadside version of Chevy Chase, the one which Addison quoted,
had been printed, with a Latin translation, in the third volume of Dryden's Miscellany (1702)
and had been appreciated along with The Nut-Brown Maid in an essay Of the Old English Poets
and Poetry in The Muses Mercury for June, 1707.
