The Hyp. (calling up one of the heavy youths). Can you whistle, Sir? Yes? Then whistle something.
(The Youth whistles a popular air in a lugubrious tone.) Now you can't whistle--try. (The Youth
tries--and produces nothing but a close imitation of an air-cushion that is being unscrewed.)
Now, if I were not to wake him up, this young gentleman's friends would never enjoy the benefit
of his whistle again!

Voice from a Back Row. Don't wake him, Guv'nor, we can bear it!

Hyp.
