Today, I can only announce this endeavor as a benefit to investors and to the unemployed seeking work, that hidden rewards will soon become clear. I can describe particular methods at a later time, including a more detailed plan of action and a list of valuable external resources, both public and private. I also hope to find strong partnerships in this endeavor to help ensure that this proposal is completed with accuracy, merit and the utmost success.

I have no further comments at this time. I hope that those who discuss and evaluate this plan do so with researched facts and solid arguments, rather than petty opinions and emotionally-charged reactions.

Notes are often left in the margins of books by both scholars and learned men. These notes can be critical, evaluative, commemorative and even biographical in nature. They include the reader's personal take on the material, based on his unique background and knowledge base. This additional knowledge and insight is then passed down to subsequent owners of the book, enriching later reading experiences. This essay focuses on the side notes found in various texts.
