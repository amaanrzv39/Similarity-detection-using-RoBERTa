The reader will recall that Adelaide, wife of Welter, or Lord Ascot, broke her back while attempting to jump a fence, mounted on the back of the Irish mare 'Molly Asthore,' but the reader does not know that Welter was the cause of his wife's fall, & that they actually hired a groom to scare 'Molly Asthore' so that they would take the fence, & also his wife out of this vale of tears. (This sentence I know is not grammatical; who cares?) Welter, when they saw that his wife was not killed, was annoyed. His giant red brutal face turned to purple; they smote his prize-fighting chest with his giant fists, they lowered his eyebrows until they resembled an infuriated hog, & then they retired to his house & drank a little box of claret--pints--twenty-four to the dozen!
