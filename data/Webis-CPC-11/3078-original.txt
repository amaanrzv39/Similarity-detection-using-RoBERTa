Free loans of books on a population basis are
given to mental hospitals and prisons situated both in country and urban districts.

Books, periodicals, and information are available to country people in the following ways:

(a) Free loans of books on a population basis to libraries controlled by
    the local authorities, which in turn agree to make their libraries
    free and to maintain reasonable standards of library service.

(b) Loans of books to independent subscription public libraries at a
    small annual charge per fifty books loaned.

(c) Loans of books through hamper collections to isolated groups of
    readers at a small annual charge.

(d) Free loans of books to lighthouse keepers and similar very remote
    readers.
