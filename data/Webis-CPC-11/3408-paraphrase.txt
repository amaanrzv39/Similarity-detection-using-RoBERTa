The guns were already so much heated via the incessant flame kept up, that we were constrained towards dampen the bullets nearly one-half, as well as towards wait their cooling ahead of reloading; the men, too, were so decimated at a number of guns, that they required the assistance of the others towards profession them; the aftermost gun onto the gangway had alone two men deserted untouched, Between seven and eight o'clock, the flame of the enemy's guns had sensibly dampened, and their civilians were operating within crowds from the destroyed works towards the great gate of the city; they were distinctly sighted within everybody their motions via the light of their burning navy and arsenal. The battery within the upper angle of the town, which, was too tall towards flame upon, kept up a galling flame, and another further towards the eastward was still at work. To fetch our broadside towards carry upon it, a hawser was operate out towards the Severn, onto our larboard bow, the ship was dangled towards the proper bearing, and we soon checked them. At 45 minutes beyond nine, the squadron began towards pull out, a number of making sail, and taking advantage of a light air off the land, whilst others were towing and warping: the alone sail which we had install towards predetermined, was the main-topmast staysail, and this was of too stout canvass towards feel the breeze; the boats of our own ship were unable towards move her, as soon as a kedge anchor, which was operate out towards the length of the stream-cable, had arrive home; hence we were deserted, dependant either onto a breeze or the assistance of the squadron. An officer was posted towards tell the admiral our situation, but the boat was sunk from below the crew, whom were chosen up via another; a second boat was many successful, and the admiral commissioned everybody the boats he could compile towards our assistance.
