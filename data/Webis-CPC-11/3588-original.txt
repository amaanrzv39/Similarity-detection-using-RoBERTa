It put
an end to the legitimate supplies of grain which those countries had been accustomed to contribute;
it forced their populations to crowd into already overcrowded Italy, and increase the requirements
of food in a country which had been exploited like their own, and, though not so rapidly, yet
by similar means;[1] and it gave rise to the servile wars, to the most corrupt period in Roman
history, to the Empire, and to the endless series of consequences in its train.

[Footnote 1: Although the various states of Italy were conquered by Rome before Greece was,
it is probable that emphyteusis was not employed in those states until after the year B.C.
146--between that and B.C. 120.]

After the Western Empire had apparently fallen beneath the Northern arms--that is to say, five
hundred years later--and not until then, the Roman Code ameliorated the baneful tenure of emphyteusis.
A law of the emperor Zenos (A.D. 474-491) fixed whatever had theretofore been uncertain in
the nature and incidents of emphyteusis. The tenant was guaranteed from increase of rent and
from eviction--the alienation of the property by the state being held thenceforth to affect
the quit-rent only--and finally he obtained full power to dispose of the land, which nevertheless
remained subject to the quit-rent in whatever hands it might be. Before these reforms were
effected, Portugal was conquered by the Visigoths, the Roman proprietors of the soil were expelled,
and their laws and institutions suppressed.
