For the purposes of facilitating the manufacture of similar tissues on the power loom, the asteemed Swiss manufacturer, Hanneger, has invented an apparatus that does not throw the shuttle. Instead, it passes from one side to the other by the use of hooks, by a process akin to weaving silk by hand.  A loom that is built in this way was displayed at work weaving silk at the Paris Eshibition of 1878.  This apparatues, shown in the annexed figure, has arrangements that are new and innovative.  On each side of the woof in the heddle there is a carrier, B. These carriers have hooks, A A', which themselves have appendages, a a', which are secured in the shuttle, O. The latter is a strange construction.
