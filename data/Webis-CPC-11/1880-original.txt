The admirable organization of the contractors was something wonderful. The grading work was
practically all done by sub-contractors, Messrs. Langdon, Sheppard & Co. confining themselves
to putting in the supplies and doing the bridge work, surfacing, and track-laying. The grading
forces were scattered along about 150 miles ahead of the track and supply stores, established
about 50 miles apart, and in no case were sub-contractors expected to haul supplies over 100
miles.
