Finally I overcame my repugnance sufficiently to call upon Maitre Mouche.  The first thing
I remarked was that his office is much more dusty and much more mouldy this year that it was
last year.  The notary made his appearance after a moment, with his familiar stiff gestures,
and his restless eyes quivering behind his eye-glasses. I made my complaints to him.  He answered
me....  But why should I write down, even in a notebook which I am going to burn, my recollections
of a downright scoundrel?  He takes sides with Mademoiselle Prefere, whose intelligent mind
and irreproachable character he has long appreciated.  He does not feel himself in a position
to decide the nature of the question at issue; but he must assure me that appearances have
been greatly against me.
