It is my desire that by the occasion of this discourse, I may raise up some more active spirit
to a search after other hidden and unknowne truthes. Since it must needes be a great impediment
unto the growth of sciences, for men still so to plod on upon beaten principles, as to be afraid
of entertaining any thing that may seeme to contradict them. An unwillingnesse to take such
things into examination, is one of those errours of learning in these times observed by the
judicious Verulam.
