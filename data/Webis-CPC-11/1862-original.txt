Of
the authoress, Mrs H. B. Stowe, it may be said, that her chief merit consists in close observation
of character, with a forcible and truth-like power of delineation. In plot, supposing her to
aim at such a thing, she decidedly fails, and the winding-up of her dramatis person√¶ is hurried
and imperfect. Notwithstanding these defects, however, she has succeeded in rivetting universal
attention, while her aims are in the highest degree praiseworthy.
