He prayed, held hands to her, and did not dare to touch her. "What do I do ... to convince you?"

She looked at him again.

Regarding your mother's request is concerned - first, how could I refuse - and? Secondly, I think I made the request in so you could guess ....'

"Yesterday."

"You see?"

"Yes. At home. He came to see us."

"Gemma? Then you love me?"

She turned to him.
