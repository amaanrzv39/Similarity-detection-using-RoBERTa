Such a virtue could not be vegetable in its nature, but was, he thought, connected with metals.
He pointed to the well-accepted medicinal virtues which inhered in gems. Metals also had great
medicinal potency. Antimony, lead, iron, mercury, were well known, and of special importance
was copper, the Venus of the early chemists.

The medicinal virtue which inhered in Butler's stone and in other powerful fermental remedies,
van Helmont designated as "drif," which he said means, in the vernacular, virgin sand or earth.
This virtue requires a metallic body in which to inhere. The general concept is not unfamiliar,
of a virtue or power or ferment which was attached to a material object, and it is this type
of explanation which was so preponderant in, for example, Porta's Natural Magick.
