When fanciful speculators seek to imagine what kind of living beings might
be encountered on the other planets of our system, they usually make calculations as to the
force of gravity on the surface of these planets and conjure up from such data the possible
size of the inhabitants, their relative strength and agility of movement, etc. So far so good.
But the first question we should ask, before proceeding to our speculative synthesis, should
rather be the length of the planet's diurnal rotation and annual revolution periods. Certain
planets, such as Mars and Venus, have rotation periods not very different from those of our
own Earth.[14:1] Other things being equal, therefore, a certain similarity of animal life must
be supposed possible on these planets. On the other hand, the marked difference in their revolution
period would lead us to expect a very wide divergence between their lower forms of life, if
any such there be, and our own terrestrial vegetation. The shorter the annual period the more
would the vegetal approximate to the animal, and vice versa. It would, however, be foolish
to waste more time over a speculation so remote.

But these two facts remain unshaken:--(1) That our measurements and whole science of Time depend
absolutely on the operation throughout Nature of the Law of Periodicity, and (2) that the periodicities
which affect and determine animal and vegetal life upon our Earth are the periodic movements
of rotation and revolution of that Earth itself.
