The principal materials of which they are built are limestone, granite, marble
and bricks, and terra-cotta of various colours.

The city hall, the post-office and the court-house, standing in a row, and each occupying a
separate block along E. Fayette Street in almost the exact centre of the city, are three of
Baltimore's most imposing buildings, and all of them narrowly escaped destruction by the great
fire. The city hall, completed in 1875, in the Renaissance style, consists of a centre structure
of four storeys surmounted by an iron dome 260 ft. high, and two connecting wings of three
storeys surmounted by a mansard roof; the entire outer facing is of white Maryland marble.
The post-office, completed in 1890, is built of Maine granite.
