Not so another Roman citizen, or English
travelling gent., who losing, perhaps, seven-and-sixpence, wrote a furious letter to the "Times,"
complaining of such horrors existing under the British flag, desecration of the English name,

but play on a diminutive scale has since, I have been given to understand, recommenced there
without molestation.
