I am well educated that there have been two recent poems which talk about our hero's rise from the dead in the Days of King Edgar.  The schoolmaster, along with others, inform me that these were written in the last century and these have since been printed by the followers of Monsieur Marion and the resurrection of Dr. Ems.
