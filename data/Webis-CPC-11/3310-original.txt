They remained quite quiet. We rode round them, and
in like manner got in rear of a second and third drove, and then began to spread out, so as
to form a half circle, and drive the cattle towards the house.

Hitherto my mustang had behaved exceedingly well, cantering freely along and not attempting
to play any tricks. I had scarcely, however, left the remainder of the party a couple of hundred
yards, when the devil by which he was possessed began to wake up. The mustangs belonging to
the plantation were grazing some three quarters of a mile off; and no sooner did my beast catch
sight of them, than he commenced practising every species of jump and leap that it is possible
for a horse to execute, and many of a nature so extraordinary, that I should have thought no
brute that ever went on four legs would have been able to accomplish them. He shied, reared,
pranced, leaped forwards, backwards, and sideways; in short, played such infernal pranks, that,
although a practised rider, I found it no easy matter to keep my seat. I began heartily to
regret that I had brought no lasso with me, which would have tamed him at once, and that, contrary
to Mr Neal's advice, I had put on my American bit instead of a Mexican one. Without these auxiliaries
all my horsemanship was useless. The brute galloped like a mad creature some five hundred yards,
caring nothing for my efforts to stop him; and then, finding himself close to the troop of
mustangs, he stopped suddenly short, threw his head between his fore legs, and his hind feet
into the air, with such vicious violence, that I was pitched clean out of the saddle.
