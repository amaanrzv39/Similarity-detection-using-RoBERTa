If this bait takes your friend in, and he comes with a reckless lunge
at it, throwing all his heart into the cut, spring up to your full height, heels together,
and leg well out of danger, and gently let your avenging rod fall along his spine. This, by
the way, is the only occasion, except when you are acknowledging a hit, on which you may be
allowed to desert the first position for legs and feet.

But this is a very old ruse, and most players know it: a much better one may be founded upon
it.
