(BY MR. PUNCH'S OWN PROPHET.)

Various events are approaching, and it is only fair that I should give the readers of this
journal the benefit of my advice and my opinions. In good time I shall have something to say
about Goodwood--something that will make the pal√¶olithic cauliflower-headed dispensers of buncombe
and bombast sit up and curse the day on which fate allowed them to be born. There are some
who profess to attach importance to the goose-billed mouthings and vapourings of the butter-brained
crew who follow in the wake of the most notorious professor of humbugging pomposity that even
this age, rich as it is in putty-faced impostors, has ever produced. Well, let them. For my
own part I follow the advice of the French King to the beautiful Marquise DE CENTAMOURS.
