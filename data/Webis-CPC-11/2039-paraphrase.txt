Charles Crozat Converse has proven to be an exception to the rule by immersing himself in many philosophies.  He coined the word "thon" (a possible substitute for the pronouns "he" or "she" and "his" or "her" which can prove to be rather awkward).  This substitution has been adopted by the Standard Dictionary.

Converse was bord on October 7, 1832 in Warren Massachusetts to a family with American roots as far back as 1630.  He went to Germany after becoming well versed in English and the classics.
