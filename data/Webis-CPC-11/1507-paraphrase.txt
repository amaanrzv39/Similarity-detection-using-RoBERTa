The castle sits well above the surrounding area, serving as a landmark for local inhabitants.  It dates back to the Norman Conquest, though no records of it from that period are in existence.  On the Domesday survey it was recorded as belonging to one William Peveril, lord of Derbyshire, whose family owned it for three generations.
