A third class of stories for which an Asiatic origin may fairly be claimed, contains those
in which figures a monster or demon who cannot be killed until some external object with which
his life is mysteriously linked has been destroyed. Such a being occurs at times in European
folk-tales, especially in those of the east and north of Europe. The most familiar instance
is that of "The Giant who had no Heart in his body" of the "Tales from the Norse." Some of
the best specimens of this kind of monster are to be found in the Russian tales about Koshchei
the Deathless. But these remarkably abnormal beings scarcely seem at home in western folk-lore.
They are but little in keeping with their European surroundings, and never seem to divest themselves
of their alien air.
