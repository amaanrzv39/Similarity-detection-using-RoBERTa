Then we find the
abolition of the laws of "the staple"; foreign staple towns had been abolished just before.
The "staple" was the town in which one commodity was mainly dealt in. Every commodity in England
had some particular town, where the principal market was for it; just as, with us, the boot
and shoe market of the United States is supposed to be in Boston, the money market in New York,
beef and hogs in Chicago. In England, in the Middle Ages, they really provided that a certain
trade should have its home in a certain town; not necessarily the only one, but very often
in that one only. Thus there were certain towns for the carrying on of the wool industry; you
could only trade in wool in those towns.
