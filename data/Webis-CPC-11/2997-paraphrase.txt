The dance steps are as follows:  The first cu. sett and cast off."

It is our pleasure to promote to our readers, uplifting articles about dancing.  A newly published novel describes A Dance in Hoops like this:

It started as a regular dance, but soon broke into a synchronized group wandering fluidly as if in a maze, and exchanging partners in such a manner as to awe the senses.

The only other dance of this caliber and magnitude, odd as it may be, is the dancing horses in Mr. Peakes's satirical comedy Quadrupeds.

The ever changing music brought us a delightful rendition which was quite enjoyable.
