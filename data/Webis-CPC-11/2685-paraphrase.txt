Of course, this would greatly increase the amount of pupils currently attending high schools.  Retaining those who, currently, because of disenchantment with the work offered, drop out of school entirely.  Further increasing the ranks of the low skilled, non-intellectual labor pool. And I personally feel this has to change.  If we can keep students at the 9 through 12 grade levels actively engaged in their school work, we can increase both the number and attitude that go on to higher education.  A critical thinking, driven person is of much greater value to society than one who is not.

Unfortunately there is often a misunderstanding as to the great potential these two programs have for high school students.
