The steam enters the closed space (which forms one-fourth of the circumference) through the
slide-valve, S, presses against the pistons, d, and causes the wheel to revolve in the direction
of the arrows. The slide-valve is closed by the action of the external distributing mechanism,
the piston passes beyond the steam-outlet, A, and a new piston then comes in play. Altogether,
there are six of these pistons, each one working in an aperture in the rim, and kept pressed
outwardly by means of a spiral spring.
