"Researches about Atomospheric Phenomena" written by Forster noticed several weather predictions by plants.Chickweed being one that when the flower expands freely there is no rain for a long time,when the flower is half closed the weather will be showery and when fully closed the weather will be rainy. This makes the Chickweed an excellent way to predict the weather.
  Siberian sowthistle predicts rain the next day if the flowers remain open all night.
