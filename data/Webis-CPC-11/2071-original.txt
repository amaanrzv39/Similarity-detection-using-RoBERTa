The best method, as every woman knows, is to give them to someone who is going on a long, long
journey, else he will follow and bring them back in triumph. This fondness for what is old
is a strange thing in men. It does not apply to other things--save cheese and easy chairs and
some kinds of game and drinkables. In the case of caps, boots, and trousers it is akin to mania.
It sometimes applies to dress waistcoats and evening ties, but has one of its greatest exacerbations
(beat that word, Irvin) in the matter of dressing gowns.
