Letâ€™s get together  to make it louder


I and others resolved to sing with correct harmony, and with rather a louder tone than they might do if only an ordinary singer in the worship of the day as a congregational attendant and that the means of drawing forth the universal voices of congregations is by a number. It is a number between four and twelve, being approved by the people in charge of the clergyman or minister.  In a few months, these four or more voices would have the effect of effecting a great improvement in the way the congregation at large sings; but in this process the main purpose of such an appointment must not be left out.
