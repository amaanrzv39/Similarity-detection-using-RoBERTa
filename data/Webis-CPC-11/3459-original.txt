them he is little more than a buffoon. To Southern Europe, he is the bold, prompt, shrewd,
popular ideal, suiting himself by craft to every superior, regarding all things with a shoulder-shrugging,
quizzical philosophy; a democratic Mephistopheles; a lurking devil, equalizing himself, and
the people with him, by wit and insolence, with nobility itself. Among the Latin races, as
in the East, such Figaros often rise, like Oliver le Daim, to power, and the people understand it.

Fast-Day, in Boston, was operatically fÃªted with 'the light and melodious Martha,' by that
arch-thief of melodies, Flotow. Would not--considering the day in question--I Puritani have
been more appropriate for 'a day of fasting and prayer'? It has already been discovered (by

    Comptroller of Stamps, and Charles Lamb's 'Diddle diddle
    dumpling,' and 'Allow me to look at the gentleman's phrenological
    development.' I am always reminded by it of a circumstance which
    occurred between the Rocky and Alleghany mountains. A certain
    witty professor of a certain Western college, had been invited to
    deliver a poem before the Phi Beta Society of Athens--not the
    capital of Greece, nor the Athens of America, but a sort of
    no-town, without even the advantages of an established groggery,
    or mutual admiration society.
