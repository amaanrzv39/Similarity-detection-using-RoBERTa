Conspire to raise the sound.

It is the conviction not only of myself but of others who are in the same order of the musical
profession, that the means of drawing forth the universal voices of congregations is by a number,
not less than four, nor more than twelve, being appointed by the authority of the clergyman
or minister, to sing with correct harmony, and with rather a louder tone than they might do
if only an ordinary singer in the worship of the day as a congregational attendant. Those four
(or more) voices would have the effect, in a few months, of producing a great improvement in
the singing by the congregation at large; but such an appointment must not be alienated from
its main purpose.
