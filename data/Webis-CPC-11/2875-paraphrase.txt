Curll really just paraphrases the accounts. Once in awhile he provides appreciable exerpts and highlights on references that catches his eye. Some of his commentarys are silly, or interested, like the comparing of Blefuscu with Scotland, of the storm Gulliver passes through before reaching Brobdingnag with "the South-Sea and Mississippi confusion," and of the giants with inflated South Sea stock (ll, 4). Some comments, however, come across compelling, such as his belief that "the trifling Transactions of the present English Royal Society" on insects and fossils are "finally rallied" (ll, 11-12). Curll also notes about the third voyage that "besides the political Allegory, Mr. Gulliverr has many cunning Remarks upon Men and Books, Sects, Parties, and Opinions"
