The armaments were now so much seared by the incessant blast kept up, that we were impelled to lessen the cartridges close to one-half, as well as to hold back their refrigerating before reloading; the men, too, were so lessened at some armaments, that they demanded the help of the other people to work them; the aftermost armament on the gangway had only two men left untouched, Between seven and eight o'clock, the blast of the enemy's armaments had sensibly reduced, and their population were running in assemblages from the demolished works to the many opening of the city; they were distinctly observed in all their movements by the light-weight of their consuming navy and arsenal. The storage battery in the higher viewpoint of the township, which, was too high to blast upon, kept up a galling blast, and another farther to the eastward was still at work. To carry our broadside to withstand upon it, a hawser was run out to the Severn, on our larboard bow, the vessel was turned to the appropriate bearing, and we before long checked them. At 45 minutes past nine, the squadron commenced to haul out, some making sail, and taking superiority of a light-weight air off the land, while other people were towing and warping: the only sail which we had fit to set, was the main-topmast staysail, and this was of too stout canvass to sense the breeze; the vessels of our own vessel were not able to move her, after a kedge anchor, which was run out to the distance of the stream-cable, had draw close home; hence we were left, dependant either on a breeze or the help of the squadron. An staff was conveyed to advise the admiral our circumstances, but the vessel was descended from under the crew, who were chosen up by another; a second vessel was more winning, and the admiral ranked all the vessels he could accumulate to our assistance.
