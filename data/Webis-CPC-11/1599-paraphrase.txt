Dr. B. or Dr. Safford didn't sprad the illness through exposure as it isn't proved that it is fully developed in urine, spit, or sweat.  It seems that the Gemiasmas produce fever, but we can't be sure that no other cryptogam produces malaria.  The plants described by Dr. B. were seen but eliminated as cause by me.  I want Dr. B to study this subject more, as there are few giving it th attention it demands.
