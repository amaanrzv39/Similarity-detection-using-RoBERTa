This is a gratuitous affront even when utilised to the pseudo-Christian or ecclesiastical Jehovite thought of God.

Consequently, it will be observed that the universal faultless innovation of "Immortality" is not only necessarily erroneous, but a bodily and metaphysical impossibility. The thought, if cherished by Theosophists or non-Theosophists, by Christians or Spiritualists, by Materialists or Idealists, is a chimerical illusion. But the real prolongation of human life is probable for a time so long as to show miraculous and amazing to those who view our span of alive as likely constricted to at most a two population of 100 years. We may smash, as it were, the shock of Death, and alternatively of changing colour, change a swift plunge into darkness to a transition into a brighter light.
