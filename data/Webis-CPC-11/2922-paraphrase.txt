The marines have always been fighters, -- however it took their involvement in this war to make the public aware of their importance.

"What and who are the marines?" was the common question asked repeatedly when the communiques' exploits began to be retailed. The ideas regarding them were very foggy at this time, and however a lot of us were knowledeable with what the marines could do, there are even now some of us that are not aware of who the marines are.

The Continental Congress authorized the United States Marine Corps in 1775, November 10, and this therefore distinguishes this as the oldest branch of the military in the United States service. The marines served bravely in the Revolutionary War, although were disbanded when the war closed on April 11, 1782.
