In all details relating to the protection of
these merchant vessels the navy has played a most vital part and not least of the laurels accruing
to this department of the government war service for work in the present struggle have been
those won by naval gun crews on cargo-laden ships.

The administrative work in connecting many vessels of this class is a not inconsiderable of
itself. The romance of the armed merchantmen affords material for many a vivid page, and when
in its proper place in this volume it is set forth somewhat in detail the reader will grasp--if
he has not already done so through perusal of the daily press--the fact that all the glory
of naval service in this war has not resided within the turrets of the dreadnought nor on the
deck of destroyer or patrol-vessel.

The navy organized and has operated the large transport service required to take our soldiers
overseas. At this writing not a single transport has been lost on the way to France, and but
three have been sunk returning. Transports bound for France have been attacked by submarines
time and again, and, in fact, our first transport convoy was unsuccessfully assailed, as has
been the case with other convoys throughout the past twelve months. In the case of the Tuscania,
sunk by a torpedo while eastbound with American soldiers, that vessel was under British convoy,
a fact which implies no discredit upon the British Navy, since it is beyond the powers of human
ingenuity so to protect the ocean lanes as to warrant assurance that a vessel, however well
convoyed, shall be totally immune from the lurking submarine. Again, it should be remembered,
that the British have taken about sixty per cent of our expeditionary forces across the ocean.
