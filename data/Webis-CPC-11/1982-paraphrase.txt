Browning stated, as he wife recalled in an early preface, "I never mistook pleasure for the final cause of poetry, nor leisture for the hour of the poet." You can also find this in a letter that he had printed many, many years ago.  "I never pretended to offer literature as a substitute for a cigar or game of dominoes to an idle man."  But man has made anything a demand on the reader's faculities as people, not readeres, seem to know.
