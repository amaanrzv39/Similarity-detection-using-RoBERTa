During the latter part of his residence in Paris, he directed
the Italian Opera, until it fell to Madame Catalani. It was in 1820 that the magnificent appointments
offered to the Maestro by the Court of Prussia tempted him to leave Paris for Berlin; in which
capital his last three grand operas were produced with great splendor. These were, Nourmahal
(founded on 'Lalla Rookh), Alcidor, and Agnes von Hohenstauffen. None of them, however, could
be called successful.
