When your servant came to us, he found
     we had two small young lions, wherefore by him we send them to you.
     And know, that we have received by our servants from your Master,
     three coach-horses, now a coach requires four horses to draw
     it, wherefore you must needs send us another good one of the same
     kind and size, that they may draw the coach with four horses.
     Oblige us in this by all means. Farewell: we depend upon it.
