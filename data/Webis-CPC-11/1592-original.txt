Were the Celtic tribes acquainted with it previously
to the arrival of the Phoenicians upon our shores?

It is said that the Phoenicians were indebted to the Tyrian Hercules for their trade in tin;
and that this island owed them its name of Baratanac, or Britain, the land of tin. Was the
Tyrian Hercules, or, as he was afterwards known and worshipped, as the Melkart of Tyre, and
the Moloch of the Bible, was he the merchant-leader of the first band of Phoenicians who visited
this island?
