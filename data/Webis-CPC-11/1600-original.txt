There is no report of the full development found in the urine, sputa, and sweat. Again, Dr.
B. or Dr. Safford did not communicate the disease to unprotected persons by exposure. While
then I feel satisfied that the Gemiasmas produce ague, it is by no means proved that no other
cryptogam may not produce malaria. I observed the plants Dr. B. described, but eliminated them
from my account. I hope Dr. B. will pursue this subject farther, as the field is very large
and the observers are few.
