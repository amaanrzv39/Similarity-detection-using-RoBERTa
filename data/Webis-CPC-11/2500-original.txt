It is remarkable that this town is now so much washed away by the sea, that what little trade
they have is carried on by Walderswick, a little town near Swole, the vessels coming in there,
because the ruins of Dunwich make the shore there unsafe and uneasy to the boats; from whence
the northern coasting seamen a rude verse of their own using, and I suppose of their own making,
as follows,

"Swoul and Dunwich, and Walderswick, All go in at one lousie creek."

This "lousie creek," in short, is a little river at Swoul, which our late famous atlas-maker
calls a good harbour for ships, and rendezvous of the royal navy; but that by-the-bye; the
author, it seems, knew no better.
