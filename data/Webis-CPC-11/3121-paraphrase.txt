The little fireflies were all over the place: the vines, the trees...everywhere.  And the noisy grasshoppers brought back the feeling of home.  Those were there two vivid memories I had of the haunted village of Sillano.

Every youth can remember that one vivid moment of immortality; the way the clouds crest over the hills, the colours, and scents of Paradise.  Stuff no words can ever describe and no man-made language, music, or painting could ever describe.  That elusive recollection of youth; the purity of it all, gone before we ever knew we would miss it.
