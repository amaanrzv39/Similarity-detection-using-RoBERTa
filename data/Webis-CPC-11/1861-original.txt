In quantitative analysis the methods can be subdivided into:
(a) gravimetric, in which the constituent is precipitated either as a definite insoluble compound
by the addition of certain reagents, or electrolytically, by the passage of an electric current;
(b) volumetric, in which the volume of a reagent of a known strength which produces a certain
definite reaction is measured; (c) colorimetric, in which the solution has a particular tint,
which can be compared with solutions of known strengths.
