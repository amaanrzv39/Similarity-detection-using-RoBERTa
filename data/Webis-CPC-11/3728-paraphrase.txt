Miss Rosalie toller played with much charm and sympathy, and with a grace and dignity slightly used were purely English. Serving as a foil to her taste and dress and social tradition, Miss Elsa Kolbeck DOLLY HOLMES-Gore was extraordinarily German - an outstanding performance.

Miss Caldwell as Mrs. Marianne major Kolbeck, home of Margaret, was a burden most adorable, and Miss DORA GREGORY had no difficulty in showing how the wife of a Prussian colonel, though in the eyes of her husband, her main purpose in life could minister to his inner man, may exercise authority little less than the All-Highest regiment over wives. women in society was the garrison town of Miss and Miss MAY HAYSACK VENNING one that played more than enough vivacity, a brace of giggling flappers, very curious about the dowry of the bride looked.

Miss Featherstone blades, as Lady Lushington, had little to do, and made more humane, and Mr. STUART OTHO easily illustrated with a very natural way of simple friendship between a man and a woman who needed a Anglo-Saxon intelligence to understand.

Officers, although there had been more about her blond beast, were sufficiently Prussia, and Mr. MALCOLM CHERRY, that spouse Margaret's, has indicated clearly much change in behavior of a gentleman in Germany, after marriage, to Lady he has agreed to honor with this thing he calls his heart.

Apart from one or two questionable points that I mentioned, the game went well, although it seems a pity that so much insistence should have been established on the lack of culture (in the sense in English) in households where strict economy was essential.
