Electric-Lamp Signal. Luminescent electric lamps, an important element in telecommunications, about 1890. Superior than either form of mechanical visible signals for three reasons: simple and easy to restore compared with drops; they are small; and they put off more light when used. As to the last quality, you might say they are more constant, for they give out light rather than reflecting it, as with all other visible signals. The best shape producing the best light is when the lamp signal is put behind a hemispherical lens, either slightly clouded or faceted. The hemispherical lens distributes the rays of light, resulting in a signal that can be seen from a wider angle, as shown in Fig. 24.
