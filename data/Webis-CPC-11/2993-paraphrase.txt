The numerous filaments came to be known as protoplasmic processes; the other fibre was named, after its discoverer, the axis cylinder of Deiters. It was a natural inference, though not clearly demonstrable in the sections, that these filamentous processes are the connecting links between the different nerve cells & also the channels of communication between nerve cells & the periphery of the body. The white substance of brain & cord, apparently, is made up of such connecting fibres, thus bringing the different ganglion cells everywhere in to communication one with another.
In the attempt to trace the connecting nerve tracts through this white substance by either macroscopical or microscopical methods, most important aid is given by a method originated by Waller in 1852.
