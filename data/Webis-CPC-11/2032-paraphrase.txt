Physically, they all mirrored the first one.  Each was a steep ledge, and each below had been formed the same way as the one above.  The sea, especially once it contained ice, played a large role in their shaping.  Those on the west and the north sides of the island had the most markings, obviously because they are the sides which are most exposed to the sea.

History students are interested in this because the marks show how the sea levels have changed. The sea hitting the land has marked where sea level has been in the past.
