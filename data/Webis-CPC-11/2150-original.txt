But how did the tobacco get into our picture? You can hunt up the story for yourselves in your
school histories. Had not Sir Walter Raleigh in 1586 introduced the weed to the court of Queen
Elizabeth from Virginia, our picture and social life in Arabia would be very different. The
custom of puffing tobacco has spread like a prairie fire and it is now so common in the East
that very few realise it was not always found there. There they are all together, an Indian
pipe, Arabian coffee and American tobacco!
