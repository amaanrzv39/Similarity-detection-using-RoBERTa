This once-merry holiday, originally filled with delight and wonderment, has fallen into disregard. May-Day, known also as Beltaine in some circles has been reduced to a simple, normally ignored addition to the modern calendar page. It existed in days of old as a long-expected and anxiously waited-for time to rejoice as well as pay respects to the queen. Peasants and royals alike would feast, drink, and dance from dawn till dusk. Games and traditions, such as the wrapping of the May Pole, filled the day and brought the townsfolk together in gay celebration. The air itself would thrum with song and laughter as bards entertained the crowds.
