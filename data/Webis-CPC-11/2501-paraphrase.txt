In Cymbeline, Act iii. Sc. 2., we read:

"Senseless bauble, Art thou a feodary for this act, and lookst So virgin-like without?"

where feodary distinctly means associate, accomplice. According to some, the word implies one who holds land by the same possession as the rest of humankind; whilst Mr. knight, in a remark on Henry IV. Part i. Act i. attempts to show that it includes both the associate and the feudal tenant.

"To owe" is often used by Shakespeare in the sense of to have, to own, as in Act i. Sc. 5. where Lucio says:

"but when they weep and kneel, All their petitions are as freely theirs As they themselves would owe them."

So also in the following situations:-

"The slaughter of the prince that ow'd the crown."
