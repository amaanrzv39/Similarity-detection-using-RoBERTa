THE RELIGION OF BUSINESS

In the house in which I am staying hangs an old coloured print, representing two couples, one
young and lusty, the other decrepit, the woman carrying an hour-glass, the man leaning on a
stick; and underneath, the following inscription:

    "My father and mother that go so stuping to your grave,
    Pray tell me what good I may in this world expect to have?"

    "My son, the good you can expect is all forlorn,
    Men doe not gather grapes from of a thorn."

This dialogue, I sometimes think, symbolises the attitude of the new world to the old, and
the old to the new.
