I did not have any other intrest in life. It was clear that the world had gotten away from a destructive event, and it made me happy. But it might as well have been ruined.

Even though this happened, I went to Washington. I felt that I was in debt to Hart Jones, a hero  of war, from Lindbergh. I had to at least listen to him talk.

I rode in a plane issued by the government. It seemed to me that the plane was going very slow, when really the plane was going very fast, and made the trip in record time. I do not know why I was not patient on the way to Washington, I was not intrested in anything that might happen there. I was just nervous, I guess. Everything was annoying me.
