Last night my mind hallucinated that my Poor dead master is standing right next to me and motivating me to go over. For I refused the police orders Mr Rolfe, but i acted for the best and I am sorry for that 
"Hill, I need to know the reason why you are here tonight please tell me the reason why you are here or i will call the cops and will get you arrested and it will take a lot of explanation when cops from Hampstead Police Station will arrest you along with Birchill"

Hill was looking towards the doorway as he could run away to freedom but there was no remarks on hill's face as he was facing Rolfe

Hill Said " Sir I've told you about reality but not all of it"
