(BY THE PROPHET OF MR.PUNCH)


As several events are coming, to offer the readers of this paper the assistance of my advice and opinions ,I think is only fair and just. I will concerning Goodwood have something to tell in due time-- something that shall cause the stone age cauliflower-headed prescribers of bombast and buncombe to become alert and curse the day in which they come into this world. There are those who claim the worthiness to the ill-sensed utterings and ignorances of the slack minded group who are the followers of the most ill famed professor of insane antics that even in this time, full of conartist fakes, has ever brought forth. Ah well, let them. I adhere to the words of the French King to the beautiful Marquise DE CENTAMOURS for my own belief.
