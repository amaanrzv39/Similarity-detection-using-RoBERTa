I jumped up from my chair. "Sir!" I told Fussell, who looked totally shocked. "Let me do this for you. I learned how to thread needles when I was a kid, from the seamstress who lived across the street from me in the East End." 

Before Fusell had time to protest, I grabbed the needle and thread, and with the flair of a real player, I passed the cotton through. Without waiting to hear what Fussell had to say, I ran out of the room, and now I'm sitting here, nervous as hell, a bagel on the TV tray, which I haven't even tasted yet. Am I singular?
