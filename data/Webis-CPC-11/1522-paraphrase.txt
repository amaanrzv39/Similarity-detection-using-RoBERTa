Rarely, but very rarely, she has had dreams of riding accompany by pleasurable sexual emotions (she cannot recall any actual experience to suggest this, though fond of riding). She has never had any kind of sexual dreams about a man; of late years she has rarely had erotic dreams about women. 
Her feeling toward men is friendly, but she has never had sexual appeal toward a man. She likes them as good comrades, as men like each other.
