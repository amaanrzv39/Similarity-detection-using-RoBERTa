The second hunter who was a strong, happy man and making his way in.  Wow, I thought I was going to crack him up but he cracked my up instead!  And then, bang!  Bang!  There was shooting all around me... on every side!  In order to get out of the consquences after I let loose on him two times, I left.  I have know idea what happened to him.
 
The third hunter was cracking up at the thought. I viewed you falling you crazy guy.  At first, I was convinced you were struck.  However, when you lifted that worn face and began to yell "Wor guns!" like crazy, I was convinced there was nothing wrong with you.  Hey guys, look at the guy.  It is not likely that a regular load of shot would penetrate that.

The fourth hunter, who happened to be a military man thought it was absolutely horrendous!  If I had to confront another snipe-like bird, I would rather EVELYN WOOD jerk me about rapidly for seven days.  They shouted, "Snipe to the right! Snipe to the left!  Snipe forward!  Snipe back! Get ready--get ready!!"  Wow, the bloody place is full of them, I thought.  Right away he came out, as sneaky as propelled by the wind.  My bundook shot off on its own.  After I hugged most of an oak tree, I took off!  About this time, things were getting way too warm!  Then a storm filled with hail came along and I thought to muself, this party is not worth it... no thank you--I'm off to find some shelter.  That is about all I can remember.  Thank you, Tommy.  Would you please pass that bottle of beer around?

The first hunter was encouraging him.  Think about how we are all going out of our way to make sure that a guy like that comfortable.
