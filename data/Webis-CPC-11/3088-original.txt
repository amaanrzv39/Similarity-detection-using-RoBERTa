Where are the modifications of expression to come from if the very means of expression are
defective? Thus, the Mendelssohnian rule of "getting over the ground" (des flotten Daruberhinweggehens)
suggested a happy expedient; conductors gladly adopted the maxim, and turned it into a veritable
dogma; so that, nowadays, attempts to perform classical music correctly are openly denounced
as heretical!

I am persistently returning to the question of tempo because, as I said above, this is the
point at which it becomes evident whether a conductor understands his business or not. (Figuration).
The conductor should lead accordingly.

The Adagio stands to the Allegro as the sustained tone stands to the RHYTHMICAL MOVEMENT (figurirte
Bewegung).
