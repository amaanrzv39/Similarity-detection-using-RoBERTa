The second plan that has been suggested for solving the University question in Ireland, in
one form or other, amounts to a proposal to throw open the University of Dublin, or the Queen's
University in Ireland, or both, so as to embrace in one University a number of Colleges, each
retaining its own system of religious training and discipline, and its own endowments, and
sending up its Students to pass the Examinations of the Central University, whose functions
would be reduced to those of an Examining Board.
