IN WEST AND SOUTH THERE WAS A ZIGZAC CHAIN OF HILLS.INFRONT OF THOSE HILLS THERE WAS A RICEFIELDS AND COCOA PALMS.ALL THOSE AREA WAS SEEMED TO BE EVERGREEN.WHEN WE SAW THROUGH ITS BOTTOM AND FROM A DISTANCE IT SEEMS TO BE A PYRAMID WHICH WAS PRESSED FLAT.IN FACT THERE IS A SERIES OF TERRACES BUILD AROUND A HILL.OUT OF THESE SIX OF THEM ARE RECTANGULAR IN SHAPE THEN OTHER THREE ARE CIRCULAR AND HIGHEST OF ALL OF THOSE IS A SOLID DOME,WHICH IS  CROWNED BY A CUBE AND A SPIRE.THE CIRCULAR TERACES ARE SET AND CLOSE TOGETHER ALL OF THOSE ARE MORE SIMILAR BUT HOLLOW AND PIERCED WITH LIGHTS THOUGH WHICH IS SEEN IN EACH SEATED BUDDHA.

"PURGATORIO" WHICH MEDIATES INSTRUCTIONS ON THE WALLS.THOSE INSTRUCTIONS ARE ONLY FOR SELFISH AND CRUEL BUT THE SECOND TERRACE IS RECOEDED ON ONE SIDE THE LIFE OF SAKYA MUNI ON THE OTHER HIS PREVIOUS INCARNATIONS.THE LATTER TAKEN FROM THE "JATAKAS" ARE NATIVE AND CHARMING APOLOGUES.

FOR EXAMPLE: ONCE A WHILE WHEN BUDDHA WAS LIVED AS A  HARE.IN ORDER TO TEST HIM INDRA CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN IN THE GUISE OF A TRAVELLER.EXHAUSTED AND FAINT,HE GO ON HELP WITH ANIMALS.A FISH BROUGHT OTTER AND A MONKEY A FRUIT AND A JACKAL BROUGHT HIM A CUP OF MILK.BUT THE HARE DOES NOT BROUGHT HIM ANYTHING.SO HE THROW THE HARE IN TO THE FIRE THAT THE WANDERED MIGHT EAT HIS ROASTED FLESH.AGAIN HE LIVED AS AN ELEPHANT.HE MET SEVEN HUNDRED TRAVELLERS  LOST AND EZHAUSTED WITH MORE HUNGER
