It is probable that the wind pressure is not strictly relative to the extent of the surface exposed. Pressure plates are usually of moderate size, from a half or quarter of a sq. ft. up to two or three sq. ft., are square or round, and for these sizes, and shapes, and of course for a flat surface, the relation P=.003 v^2 is fairly correct. 
In the tube anemometer also it is actually the pressure that is measured, although the scale is usually graduated as a velocity scale.
