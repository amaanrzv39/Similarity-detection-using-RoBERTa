Hitherto Deism had mainly been treated on its negative or destructive
side. The mysteries of Christianity, the limitations to thought which it imposes, its system
of rewards and punishments, its fulfilment of prophecy, its miracles, had been in turn attacked.
The question then naturally arises, 'What will you substitute in its place?' or rather, to
put the question as a Deist would have put it, 'What will you substitute in the place of the
popular conception of Christianity?' for this alone, not Christianity itself, Deism professed
to attack.
