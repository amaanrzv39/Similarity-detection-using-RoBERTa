The origin of life, any present perception may have been 'true' - if such a word then it might be applicable. Later, when the reactions have been organized, the reactions became 'true' whenever the expectation was fulfilled by them. Otherwise, were "false" or "wrong" responses. But the same class of objects needs the same type of reaction, so the impulse to react consistently must gradually have been established, and a disappointment when the expected results frustrated. Here's a perfectly plausible germ for all our major consistencies. Today, if an object claims from us a reaction of the type normally given only to the opposite class of objects, our mind machine refuses to run smoothly. The situation is intellectually unsatisfactory.

theoretical truth thus falls within the mind, with the agreement of some of its processes and objects with other processes and objects - 'agreement' that is here in well-defined relations. While the satisfaction of feeling like an agreement we are denied any collateral benefit may seem to exert what we are like dust in the balance - if we are highly organized intellectually, which most of us are not. The amount of the deal that fits most men and women is merely the absence of violent clash between their usual thoughts and statements and the limited area of sensory perception in which their lives are cast.
