Additionally, the spectra of some elements have been mapped out and drawn in much larger proportion. To date, many of these are ready for publication, including a great number of lines in the map of the solar spectrum.  Professor Rowland's research allowed for the following table of solar elements to be roughly constructed: 

Elements in the Sun, which were arranged based on their Intensity and the Number of Lines in the Solar Spectrum.
