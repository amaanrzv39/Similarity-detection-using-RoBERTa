SPERMAPHYTES: PHÃ†NOGAMS.

The last and highest great division of the vegetable kingdom has been named Spermaphyta, "seed
plants," from the fact that the structures known as seeds are peculiar to them. They are also
commonly called flowering plants, though this name might be also appropriately given to certain
of the higher pteridophytes.

In the seed plants the macrosporangia remain attached to the parent plant, in nearly all cases,
until the archegonia are fertilized and the embryo plant formed.
