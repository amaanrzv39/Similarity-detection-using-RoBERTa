in the known world, that will not, with proper care, thrive in our climate." In a visit made
by Sir W. Watson and Dr. Mitchell to Tradescant's garden in 1749, an account of which is inserted
in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. xlvi. p. 160., it appears that it had been many years
totally neglected, and the house belonging to it empty and ruined; but though the garden was
quite covered with weeds, there remained among them manifest footsteps of its founder.
