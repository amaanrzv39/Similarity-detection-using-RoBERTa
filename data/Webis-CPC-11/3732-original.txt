I rise, my Lords, to declare my sentiments on this most solemn and serious subject. It has
imposed a load upon my mind, which, I fear, nothing can remove, but which impels me to endeavor
its alleviation, by a free and unreserved communication of my sentiments.

In the first part of the address, I have the honor of heartily concurring with the noble Earl
who moved it. No man feels sincerer joy than I do; none can offer more genuine congratulations
on every accession of strength to the Protestant succession. I therefore join in every congratulation
on the birth of another princess, and the happy recovery of her Majesty.

But I must stop here. My courtly complaisance will carry me no farther. I will not join in
congratulation on misfortune and disgrace. I cannot concur in a blind and servile address,
which approves and endeavors to sanctify the monstrous measures which have heaped disgrace
and misfortune upon us. This, my Lords, is a perilous and tremendous moment! It is not a time
for adulation. The smoothness of flattery cannot now avail--cannot save us in this rugged and
awful crisis. It is now necessary to instruct the Throne in the language of truth. We must
dispel the illusion and the darkness which envelop it, and display, in its full danger and
true colors, the ruin that is brought to our doors.

This, my Lords, is our duty. It is the proper function of this noble assembly, sitting, as
we do, upon our honors in this House, the hereditary council of the Crown. Who is the minister--where
is the minister, that has dared to suggest to the Throne the contrary, unconstitutional language
this day delivered from it? The accustomed language from the Throne has been application to
Parliament for advice, and a reliance on its constitutional advice and assistance.
