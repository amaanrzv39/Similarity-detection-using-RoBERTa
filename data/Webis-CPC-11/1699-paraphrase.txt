Paine felt he made one govt with a book, why not another?  He had faith in the art of debate and his experience had proven the power.  As Carlyle, in his dramatic fashion, said of him "Je can and will free all this world; perhaps even the other."  Godwin, as become the teacher of the movement, set his sights on the slower working of education; to make men wise was to make them free.  Paine was the teacher of books of the camp.
