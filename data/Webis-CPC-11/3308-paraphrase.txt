Towards the Western side of the Church of the Frari of Venice, a Gothic fourteenth century tomb of an unidentified kight sits in the second chapel. Without an inscription, it can only be described and accounted for by its physical appearance. Under a gothic arch bearing the crest of the deceased, the tomb encloses a sarcophagus bolted to the stone walls of the chapel itself. Inside, the tomb is blanketed with a night sky, painted on to keep the knight in restful splendor through all eternity. Under the chainmail, only a small glimpse of the roughly hewn statue is visible. It wears a traditional knight's garb, from tunic to jointed limbs of steel. His crest is at his feet and his dagger by his side, as he peers off into the distance, avoiding the glances of the passers-by.
