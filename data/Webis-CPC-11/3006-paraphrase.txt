Please arrange for the grey curtains to be hung in the first room, which leads to another room. The grey curtains are in my cabinet with the piano. Also the curtains in the bedroom will remain the same, except that under these curtains keep white muslin ones, which were under the grey curtains.

I also want to have a little press in bedroom if there is enough space. It can also be in the drawing room if there is good space between the windows.

I would like to have the little sofa shifted from dining-room to the drawing-room. But it should have the red cover, matching with that of the chairs. For this we may have to call up the upholsterer, which is, I think, difficult.

Now that Domaradzki is going to be married, I can look forward to receiving the 80 francs after his wedding.
