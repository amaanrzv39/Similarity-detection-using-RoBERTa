Can you just see it, one of the ready females an on mouse-headed, coronadeficient, log-pointed glans males in the act of copulation! While the point of the uterus may be two or three inches in some other direction, making impregnation impossible, the conical penis finds it way in the reflected fold of the vagina. But in the normal shaped penis, the corona acting as a valve, behind wich the round tight fibres of the vagina close themselves, tends to retain the sperm in fron, and the very shpe of the organ assists in lengenthing out the vaginal canal in essence bringing uterus in proper position. There are no technical means to retain the seminal discharge through the long, narrow, and pointed glans, without the corona. Introducing the idea of postural copulation some years ago, and being tried in cased of sterility it has been found that pregnancy would take place in some cased where it had formerly appeared impossible. The position having the effect of righting malpositions during the act, which in turn were the cause of sterility. But in reasoning, the actual shape of the organ is what further favors the malpositions, as well as where it offers no obstcals to the vagina immediatley expressing or dropping out all the semen. Where the uterine deformity is coincident with this condition of the penis to assist, impregnation is mor difficult and becomes nigh impossible.
