We withdraw
the tangible object. The visible object, too, disappears: it leaves its place. We replace the
tangible object--the visible object reappears in statu quo. There is no occasion to vary the
experiment. If we find that the visible object invariably leaves its place when the tangible
object leaves its, and that the one invariably comes back when the other returns, we have brought
forward quite enough to establish an inevitable association in place between the two. The two
places are henceforth regarded, not as two, but as one and the same.

By the aid of the touch, then, we have associated the visual phenomena with thing which are
not the organ of vision; and well it is for us that we have done so betimes, and before we
were aware of the eye's existence.
