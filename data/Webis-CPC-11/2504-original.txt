Is not diplomacy, unkindly called by Voltaire the field of lies, as able as ever
it was to dupe governments and governed by grand abstract catchwords veiling obscure and inexplicable
purposes, and turning the whole world over with blood and tears, to a strange Witch's Sabbath?"[11]
This is his conclusion of the whole matter.

But while the reasons for the failure are not far to seek, it is worth while for the preacher
to dwell on them for a moment. In strongly centered souls like a Morley or an Erasmus, humanism
produces a stoical endurance and a sublime self-confidence. But it tends, in lesser spirits,
to a restless arrogance.
