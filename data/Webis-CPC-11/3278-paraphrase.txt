For the Chorus-Singers never elected by Suffrage at all, but hir'd by the proper officer who was at the Expence of the Chorus: and the Furnichure
of the Chours and never either Table, or Stipend, allowed them, towards their Change. To Purpose then is this Swntence, which should be a Deduction from the Premises, and yet is none, brought in? Or how comes the Reasoning to be founded upon What Was the Fact? The Mistake manifestly arises from a careless 
Transposition made in the Text: Let the two Greek Words, Which I have distinguished by Capitals, only change Places, and we recover What Platonirs meant to infer. "That the [A] Furnishers of Choru's being no longer elected by Suffrage, and the [B] Chorus's were abulished, and the Subjects of Comedies alter'd".

II.There is another more egreious Error still subsisting in this instructive Fragment, which has likewise escaped the Notice of the Learned. The Author is saying, that, in the old Comedy, the Masks were made so nearly to resemble the Persons to be satirized, that before the Actor spoke a Word, it was known whom he was to personate. But, in the New Comedy, when Athens was conquered by the Macedonians, and the Poets were fearful lest their Masks should be construed to resemble any of their New  Governors, they
 formed them so preposterously as only to move Laughter',ὁρῶμεν γοῦν (says He) τὰς ὀφρῦς ἐν τοῖς προσώποις τῆς Μενάνδρου κωμῳδίας ὁποίας ἔχει, καὶ ὅπως ἐξεστραμμένον τὸ ΣΩΜΑ. καὶ οὐδε κατὰ ἀνθρώπων φύσιν.
