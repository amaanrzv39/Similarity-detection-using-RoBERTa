After some time, we arrived at the place where the flood had begun.  There was a valley surounded by pieces of remaining embankment.  This was not what we thought it would be.  The news had claimed it was completely gone.  This was proven inaccurate for half still remained.  The Roads of Glenroy were thought to have been produced by a lake, which caused the flood.  If this was so, was there a dam?  If so, where was it?  If it had been swept away, why are there no parts of it to be found along the valley? Looking around, there seems to be a lack of evidence to support this theory.  All there seems to be is a small stream which formed only a few months ago.
