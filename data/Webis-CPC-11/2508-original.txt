Marlborough's exploits
have made a prodigious impression on the Continent. The French, who felt the edge of his flaming
sword, and saw the glories of the Grande Monarque torn from the long triumphant brow of Louis
XIV.; the Dutch, who found in his conquering arm the stay of their sinking republic, and their
salvation from slavery and persecution; the Germans, who saw the flames of the Palatinate avenged
by his resistless power, and the ravages of war rolled back from the Rhine into the territory
of the state which had provoked them; the Lutherans, who beheld in him the appointed instrument
of divine vengeance, to punish the abominable perfidy and cruelty of the revocation of the
edict of Nantes--have concurred in celebrating his exploits.
