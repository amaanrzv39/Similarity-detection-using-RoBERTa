I am glad to see you can make yourself so happy with drawing old trees and
mounds of grass.

CAPTAIN FITZCHROME.  Happy, Lady Clarinda! oh, no!  How can I be happy when I see the idol
of my heart about to be sacrificed on the shrine of Mammon?

LADY CLARINDA.  Do you know, though Mammon has a sort of ill name, I really think he is a very
popular character; there must be at the bottom something amiable about him.  He is certainly
one of those pleasant creatures whom everybody abuses, but without whom no evening party is
endurable.
