When the smoke had dissipated, a heap of ruins stood in the place of Numa's dwelling.

The sun rose and smiled upon the earth, which was strewed with the last leaves of autumn, but
where were those who had assembled at the spring-time of the year?

The evening breezes whispered mournfully through the ruined walls, and strewed the faded leaves
upon eleven grassy mounds.

The pen trembles in my hand--my heart sickens at the recital of such misery.

Would that I could believe it an imagination--the ghostly horror of a fevered brain!

Would that I could bid my gentle readers check the falling tear or tell them: "Start not with
horror; it is but romance--the creation of some fearful dream--let us awake and see it no more!"
