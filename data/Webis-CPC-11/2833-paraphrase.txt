“The Angel’s spire,” is the name for this structure since poised upon its summit is an angel covered with gilt and holding aloft a cross.  59 feet above the roof of the church, this turret rises to.  The length of the church itself is 468 feet, the length from the vaulting of the roof to the pavement is 125 feet and the towers   being 272 feet high. I could see that the church is being built in the form of a cross. Yet the transept is very close to the apse, and so the choir is confined to take up three bays of the nave, when the great ceremonies, like the coronations of the royal family, has been extended westward across the transept.
 
None are founding the naves, though there are seven chapels at the east of the church.
