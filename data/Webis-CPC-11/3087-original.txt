This copious, and, possibly, tedious grammatical display of this once active metrical element,
was forced from us as the only proper answer to the doubt revived in our own day on the versification
of Chaucer. We are too prone to believe that our forefathers were as rude as their speech,
and their speech as they; but this multitude of grammatical delicacies, retained for centuries
after the subjection of the native language by conquest, and systematically applied in the
versification of the great old poet, shows a feeling of language, and an authentic stamp of
art, that claim the most genial and sympathizing respect of a refined posterity, to their not
wholly unrefined, more heroic ancestors.
