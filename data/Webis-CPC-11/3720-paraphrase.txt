A tradition that the younger John Tradescant entered himself on a privateer against the Algerines. He hoped he might have a chance to bring apricot trees from the country. Known to have taken a voyage going to Virginia, he returned with lots of new plants. Two Tradescant were the way of bringing a wide range of species into the region. Tradescants' Aster and Spiderwort are both well known in this day, and have been immortalized, by Linn√¶us, among the botanical engineers making a brand new genus under the names of the Spiderwort.

When the older Tradescant first came to England and settled down, he created a bunch of natural history, medals, couns, and some "uncommon rarities". Information on them was written in a book published in one year during 1656. Under the name of Museum Tradescantianum, his son wrote it. This Museum was often visited by upper-citzens including, Charles the First, henrietta Maria, Robert and William Cecil, Earls of Salisbury,Archbishop Laud, George Duke of Buckingham, and many others.

"Sept. 17, 1657, I went to see Sir Robert Needham, at Lambeth, a relation of mine, and thence to John Tradescant's museum."
