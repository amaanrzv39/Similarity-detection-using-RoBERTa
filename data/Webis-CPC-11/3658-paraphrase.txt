Some time after, our prayers were answered and there came the railroad, skilled laborers, and foreign investment. These came initially to prospect for gold, and later for to build mines, and they took considerable risks at a time when neither venture was profitable. Why should we begrudge them their success, now that our nation has profited from their investment? Without them, gold would still be in its hiding place underground. Today there are at least 100,000 immigrants, whose total capital investment probably exceeds 200,000,000. Should we take advantage of them now, as though we had invited them under false pretenses? After all, they - especially the English immigrants - have taken us at our word and have counted upon us to treat them honestly. Is it fair to dwell upon old hurts, which we had claimed to put behind us? Consider God's dealings with own people. The voortrekkers were poor, desperate wanderers, but God blessed them and their children. As it is said, "The beggar was raised from the asch-hoop ("ash-heap", i.e. dunghill) to sit with princes" and "a table laid for us in the sight of our enemies." For us this has been fulfilled. Our President and our representatives have met with the crowned heads of Europe, and our nation is wealthy enough to be the envy of its enemies. And who is that enemy but the Devil himself, who pursecuted our Dutch and Huguenot forefathers for their belief in God, and who has pursued us ever since?
