In the evening, when her mother's work was done, she would sit down under the sparkling vault
of heaven, and calling her children to her, would talk to them of the only Being that could
effectually aid or protect them.  Her teachings were delivered in Low Dutch, her only language,
and, translated into English, ran nearly as follows:-

'My children, there is a God, who hears and sees you.' 'A God, mau-mau! Where does he live?'
asked the children.  'He lives in the sky,' she replied; 'and when you are beaten, or cruelly
treated, or fall into any trouble, you must ask help of him, and he will always hear and help
you.'  She taught them to kneel and say the Lord's Prayer.  She entreated them to refrain from
lying and stealing, and to strive to obey their masters.
