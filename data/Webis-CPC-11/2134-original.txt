Two lessons we must have as a capital to work with, and all else that we need will grow legitimately
out of exercise in those two. “First, The elementary ideas. Second, The elementary words significant
to them.” Such was doubtless given man, as the Bible teaches, as a capital stock, and all languages
are, directly or indirectly, from this original stock, and its results upon the human understanding;
for who can set limits to possibilities of the human mind when once it is furnished with a
capital stock and learned the art of its use?
