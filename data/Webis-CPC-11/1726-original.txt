I am very well Appris'd, That there has been publish'd Two
Poems lately, Intituled, The Second and Third Parts of this Author; which treat of our little
Hero's rising from the Dead in the Days of King Edgar: But I am inform'd by my Friend the Schoolmaster,
and others, That they were compos'd by an Enthusiast in the last Century, and have been since
Printed for the Establishment of the Doctrine of Monsieur Marion and his Followers, and the
Resurrection of Dr. Ems.
