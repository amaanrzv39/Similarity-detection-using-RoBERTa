The Thames can hardly called a stream, after this part these days; it must have been determined by the weather whether there were any significant amount of water in the upper part of the Thames or not, even in the eighteenth century and earlier, before Severn and Thames Canals were dug.  It would possibly be discovered, even when the supply of water had not been diminished by modern engineering that the mills at Somerford Keynes were not continually working throughout the year.
