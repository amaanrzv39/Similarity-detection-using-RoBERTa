A few days after Colebe's wife had her child, she brought it to Governor Philip's house. Being that the child was female, the governer whished to see the operation if the finger were to be cut off. The child being two months of age had a ligature applied around the little fingure where the second joint lied. Though a few days later when the child was seen again the ligature had either been broken or taken off. After mentioning to the childs mother, she took hairs from a present officers head and tightly wrapped them around the childs finger. Some time passed and gangrene had taken place. When touching the child's injured fingure she apeared to be made uncomphortable though she did not fuss over it. Colebe's child didn't seem to mind after the ligature had been applied.
