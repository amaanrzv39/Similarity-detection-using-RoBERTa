The amount of respectable tradesmen that are summoned to the first meeting will always be more that the number used for the inquest.  This is because it can be very difficult for them to give their services.  There are valid excuses for why duties cannot be performed, but weak excuses are not permitted.  If it is the tradesman's turn to serve, and he does not wish to and cannot provide a good reason, then he either has to pay a fine, or go ahead and serve.
