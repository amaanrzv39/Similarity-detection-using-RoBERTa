Such a system of government, which could only have been found tolerable if
it had been swayed by a brotherhood of saints and sages, was, as a matter of fact, worked in
the worst manner possible and for the worst purposes. The conditions under which the vast mass
of the French people lived, struggled, suffered, and died were so cruel that it is hard indeed
to believe them compatible with the high degree of civilization which, in other respects, France
had reached.  A merciless and most comprehensive process of taxation squeezed life and hope
out of the French nation {292} for the benefit of a nobility whose corruption was only rivalled
by its worthlessness and an ecclesiasticism that had forgotten the Sermon on the Mount and
the way to Calvary.

But if the condition of France was bad it contained the germs of improvement.  A greater freedom
of thought, a greater freedom of speech were beginning, very gradually, to assert themselves
and to make their influence felt.  Philosophical speculation on sorrow and suffering turned
the minds of men to thoughts of how that sorrow might be stanched and that suffering abated.
The slowly rising tide of thought was blown into an angry sea by a wind from the west, and
in a little while a scarcely suspected storm became a hurricane that swept into a common ruin
everything that opposed its fury.  England had long been looked up to by French reformers as
the pattern for the changes they desired to see brought about in their own country.
