T is needed to repeat things that are written and said in this column of this book.  In my opinion parks exist so that people can bring this country into the  city and give alot back to people who live in  the city limits.   City people will enjoy the fresh air which can only be found in nature and beauty of natural objects that are arranged by the almighty God himself.
