About the Detroit river, along which the city extends for about 10 m., is here Â½ m. wide and 30 ft. to 40 ft. deep. Beautiful clear blue water and its current is quite rapid. It has a width of about 10 m., and in the river there are a number of islands. During the summer are popular resorts. 

The city has a 3 m. frontage on the river Rouge, an estuary of the Detroit, with a 16 ft. channel. Before the fire by which the city was destroyed in 1805, the streets were only 12 ft. wide and were unpaved and extremely dirty.

Later it was  rebuilt. Then several avenues from 100 ft. to 200 ft. wide were through the influence of Augustus B. Woodward (c. 1775-1827), one of the territorial judges at the time and an admirer of the plan of the city of Washington--made to radiate from two central points.
