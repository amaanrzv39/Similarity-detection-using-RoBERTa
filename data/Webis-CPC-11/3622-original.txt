Others of less merit were detached for
the civil service, and in that also their careers were at the imperial mercy. They were daily
and hourly reminded of Napoleon's greatness, for twenty-four hundred foreigners from the vassal
states of the Empire were scattered among these institutions, where they were turned into Frenchmen
and docile subjects at the Emperor's expense, while being virtually held as hostages for the
good behavior of their parents. These powerful engines did not work in vain. During the comparatively
short existence of the Empire their product assumed enormous proportions, and largely modified
the temper of society throughout France. The youth educated by priests or tutors were found
unable to keep pace with their favored contemporaries from the government schools, and from
the first no prophet was needed to foretell the destiny of private institutions and ecclesiastical
seminaries. Little by little they made way for or became annexed to the lyceums which one after
another were founded wherever needed. The charges of the latter were, and are, very low; and
thrifty fathers appreciate the fact. The state is at enormous cost to support them; but public
sentiment, preferring indirect to direct taxation, approves of the expenditure, while crafty
statesmen, whether royalist, imperialist, or republican, employ them to create citizens of
the kind in power at the time.

Throughout the late summer and autumn of 1807 the imperial court was more stately than ever
before.
