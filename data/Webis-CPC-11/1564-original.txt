Be this as it may, the Bill, as I have said, was
thrown out, while another,[104] which proved almost a dead letter, was passed in the following
year. It was required by this Act that licences should be granted "to all persons who shall
desire the same." Reports of abuses were to be made to the College of Physicians, to be suspended
in the College for perusal "by whosoever should apply for that purpose;" but the College had
no power to punish delinquents.
