Dr. Edward Tyson, F.R.S., was the author of various works, but none on mental disease. His
portrait is in the College. He died in 1708, aged 58, and was buried in St. Dionys Backchurch,
where there is a monument to his memory. He is the Carus of Garth's Dispensary.[90]

    "In his chill veins the sluggish puddle flows,
     And loads with lazy fogs his sable brows;
     Legions of lunaticks about him press,
     His province is lost Reason to redress."

Of the family whose hereditary connection with Bethlem is so remarkable, it should be chronicled
that Dr. James Monro was elected physician to Bethlem, 1728; he died 1752. His son describes
him as "a man of admirable discernment, who treated insanity with an address that will not
soon be equalled."
