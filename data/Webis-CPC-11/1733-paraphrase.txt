"Dog." The only uncertainty is if the offspring of this cross is a mule, and, like other mules, incapable of breeding; or whether it will multiply? The latter is held by Mr. Bell, in his History of British Quadrupeds. "The dog and wolf will breed together (he says), and their offspring are fertile." But question, are there any authentic examples of a cross between a dog and a wolf, producing a prolific animal?
