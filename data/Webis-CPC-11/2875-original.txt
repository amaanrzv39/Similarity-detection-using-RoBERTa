Curll merely summarizes
the narratives, occasionally providing substantial extracts or sprinkling explanatory comments
on some allusions that attract him. Some of the annotations are ridiculous, or curious, like
the equations of Blefuscu with Scotland, of the storm Gulliver passes through before reaching
Brobdingnag with "the South-Sea and Mississippi Confusion," and of the giants with inflated
South Sea stock (II, 4). Some remarks, however, appear convincing, such as his belief that
"the trifling Transactions of the present English Royal Society" on insects and fossils are
"finely rallied" (II, 11-12). Curll also notes about the third voyage that "besides the political
Allegory, Mr. Gulliver has many shrewd Remarks upon Men and Books, Sects, Parties, and Opinions"
