We were made to stay to supper by the aging man, but after we were rushed off, so that we could make it over The Mountains before sunset.

As we begun the temperature was cold, as snow flakes were falling. We had with us the things we needed for comfort. Our aging horse trotted quickly as usual on the way home; the wind blowing just the right way; our carriage contained a tilted down top, and a boot that flipped up. Soon we shall be home. Well, no negative can be found in going after a girl that you have never met.

Two idiots we surely were not.
