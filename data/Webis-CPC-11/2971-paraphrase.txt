A representative of the Chemists and Druggists' Union felt that travel abroad was a bad idea and that it was unwise to underestimate the severity of colds. Staying at home, treating this ailment with speed and consistency, would be the best course of action.

It is worth noting that George, a well known physician himself, thought quinine had some value but in this case aspirin should be treated like the plague.
