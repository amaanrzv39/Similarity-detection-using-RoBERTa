Nor can we comprehend the pertinence of our contributor's disquisition on the great question
of free will and necessity, as applicable to our ideas of the relations existing between mind
and matter. 'Spirit acts independently of God,' says he. We might well question the truth of
this assertion; but we may equally well admit it, so far as any inference may be drawn against
the positions we have assumed. The question is not whether the soul of man is compelled to
action according to the law of its creation, or is permitted by spontaneous choice to follow
its own independent will. This is not point of disagreement; for we have expressed no opinion
on this subject, nor upon any other which involves it.
