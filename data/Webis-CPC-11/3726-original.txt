Presently he spoke.

"Ever since I married you and Lucette Barbond, you have stood in the way of her duty, Bagot.
How well I remember that first day when you knelt before me!  Was ever so sweet and good a
girl--with her golden eyes and the look of summer in her face, and her heart all pure!  Nothing
had spoiled her--you cannot spoil such women--God is in their hearts.  But you, what have you
cared?  One day you would fondle her, and the next you were a savage--and she, so gentle, so
gentle all the time.  Then, for her religion and the faith of her child--she has fought for
it, prayed for it, suffered for it.  You thought you had no need, for you had so much happiness,
which you did not deserve--that was it.  But she: with all a woman suffers, how can she bear
life--and man--without God?  No, it is not possible.  And you thought you and your few superstitions
were enough for her.--Ah, poor fool!  She should worship you!  So selfish, so small, for a
man who knows in his heart how great God is.--You did not love her."

"By the Heaven above, yes!" said Bagot, half starting to his feet.

"Ah, 'by the Heaven above,' no! nor the child.  For true love is unselfish and patient, and
where it is the stronger, it cares for the weaker; but it was your wife who was unselfish,
patient, and cared for you.  Every time she said an ave she thought of you, and her every thanks
to the good God had you therein.  They know you well in heaven, Bagot-- through your wife.
Did you ever pray--ever since I married you to her?"
