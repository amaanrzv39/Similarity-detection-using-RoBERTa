It finally put an end to the licit supplies of grain which those countries had been acquainted to supply; which resulted in increase in their populations into already overcrowded Italy, and requirement of food was increased in a country which had been victimised like their own, and, evebthough not so rapidly, but still by similar means;[1] and it ended in abject wars, to the most fraudulent time in the history of Rome, to the Empire, and to the endless series of consequences in its train. 

[Footnote 1: Despite the fact that various Italian states were conquered by Rome before Greece, possibility is that no emphyteusis was employed in those states until after the year B.C. 146-between that and B.C. 120]

After the Western Empire had evidently fallen below the Northern arms--that is to say, after five hundred years later-- and not until then, the Roman Code amended the deadly administration of emphyteusis. A law of the emperor Zenos (A.D.474-491) defined whatever had therefore been uncertain in the nature and incidents of emphyteusis. From increase of rent and eviction the resident was guaranteed--the property alienation by the state being held hence to affect the quit-rent only--and finally he obtained full power to dispose of the land, which in whatever hands it might be reamained open to the quit-rent. Visigoths conquered Portugal, Expelles Roman proprietors of the soil, suppressed their laws and instituitions even before these reforms were effected.
