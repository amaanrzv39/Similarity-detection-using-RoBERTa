These were then
sintered. The third was the "paste" process already described. These methods produced fragile
filaments, but their luminous efficiency was higher than that of previous ones. However, in
this country ductile tungsten was soon on its way. An ingot of tungsten is subjected to vigorous
swaging until it takes the form of a rod. This is finally drawn into wire.

Much of this development work was done by the laboratories of the General Electric Company
and they were destined to contribute another great improvement.
