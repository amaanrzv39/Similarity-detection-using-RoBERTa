The sixteenth of a lottery ticket, which is the smallest share that can be purchased, has not
for many years been sold under thirty shillings, a sum much too large for a person who buys
old shoes 'translated,' and even for the 'translator' himself, to advance; we may therefore
safely conclude that the purchase of tickets is not the mode of gambling by which Crispin's
customers are brought to distress.

A great number of foreign lotteries still exist in vigorous operation.
