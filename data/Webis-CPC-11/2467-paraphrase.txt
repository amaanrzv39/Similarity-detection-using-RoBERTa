In his account of a great fight he had with the Kayans, Lingire described how he was able to kill ninety-one men and caused their army to retire defeated. When asked whether the Kayans had used sumpitan, he said yes but went on the relate how many of his men did not die from the wounds, since they knew how to cure them. His testimony adds to the body of evidence which confirms Mr. Crawfurd's theory that this poison is not as potent to destroy life if the arrow is instantaneously removed from the wound, as is usually the case.

Lingire then described the arrival of 26th.--Linn, a Sakarran chief who came to avow their surrender and thier hope for peace.
