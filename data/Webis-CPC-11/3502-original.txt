Margaret
would have worried, had she herself yet come in from her classes; as for Helen, who would have
looked with a sanguine eye at her own shroud, she was sure no harm could happen while Frederick
had the reins. So she busied herself in giving things as cheerful an aspect as possible when
everybody should have reached home.

But, in the first place, there were no coals. Helen had caught a pain in her side picking up
the very last with her fingers. Nevertheless, she had put a bright face upon it, and, after
threatening to set fire to the house and run away by the light of it, had decided that it would
be better still to set fire to it and remain and be warmed by it, while Margaret declared they
would never know what luck was again till they had made soap from the ashes. All that, however,
had put nothing into the coal-bin.

Yesterday, Helen had received five dollars for transferring a piece of embroidery for a wealthy
acquaintance. She had hesitated about accepting it; it would be the first Fotherington that
ever took wages,--Margaret's pay was salary; but conscience put down pride, and she gave thanks,
and shut her purse,--and perhaps it broke the spell. In such a household one would have thought
there would of course be no question what to do with it. On the contrary, it was a grave question.
Should Tommy have a hat and Sarah a hood? should the mother have a shawl? should it buy a quarter
of a ton of coal? And there was the lyceum! Now, in the town where they lived, not to attend
the lyceum was not to be in society; last winter they had managed to effect one season-ticket,
and the girls had gone alternately, in a neighbor's company; this winter Frederick was at home,
and two tickets were desirable.
