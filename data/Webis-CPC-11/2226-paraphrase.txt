It is a much bolder range of mountains, but it is vastly less livable, productive, or convenient of access. The winters there are severely cold, and the nights in summer are too cold and damp for health and comfort, as I know by individual experience of two summers on Nantahala River. But the trout fishing is away from comparison, and that is one inducement of great value for a stout consumptive who is a good fellow. These mountains are much more wrecked up into branches, peaks, and spurs than the Cumberlandâ€™s.
