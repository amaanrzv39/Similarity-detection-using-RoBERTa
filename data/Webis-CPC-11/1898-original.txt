When the dinner-bell rang, we agreed that
we would start off together as soon as we could for the apple-orchard at the top of the hill,
where we were not likely to be disturbed.

That hot July afternoon, how well I remember it! All among the long grass we lay, looking up
at the little, young apples overhead, and now and then setting our teeth in the sour middles
of those that had fallen. But we were a little afraid of the effects of these unripe, bullet
things, so we did no more than taste them.
