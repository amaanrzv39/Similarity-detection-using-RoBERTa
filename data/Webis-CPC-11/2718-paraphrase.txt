The skull of improved and civilized nations among the wooly-haired people of Africa, there is some slight deviation from the form which could get looked on as the usual type of a human's head. M. Golberry assures us that the loloffs who carry a deep black color and who have wooly hair are healthy in strength and build, with normal features. They carry facial features which inspire confidence. They are an honest, generous, and faithful people. The women are mild and full of beauty and great form and highly agreeable. On the other side of the equinoctal line, the Congo Negroes, do not carry big lips or ugly features, but they have a similar color to the Portugese according to Pigafetta.
