It was forced from us as the only proper answer to the uncertainty revived in our own day on the versification of Chaucer, his plentiful, and, most likely, dreary grammatical display of this once active metrical element.  We may just plainly conclude that our forefathers and their speech were rude.  Yet, we find from this massive amount of grammatical treat, which has been retained even after invasion by the native language and applied methodically in the work of the renowned poet, a feeling of language and a genuine mark of art. The most genial and respect of a refined posterity is claimed by this aspect to their rustic, but somewhat refined, heroic ancestors.
