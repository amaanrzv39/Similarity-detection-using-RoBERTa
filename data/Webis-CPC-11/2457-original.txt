Should he cross the line between
the holes, the buried pieces would fly out of the holes, snap together on him, and, flying
up the tree from which they came, would keep him prisoner for a hundred years.

Quicoy was happy to think that he could capture the Ongloc, and resolved to go that very night.
He wanted some of the boys to go with him, but they said he must go alone or the charm would
be broken. They also told him to be careful himself and not cross the line between the holes
or he would be caught as easily as the Ongloc.
