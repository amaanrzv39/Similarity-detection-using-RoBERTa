Tradition says that this church once adjoined
the town, but that the latter shifted in the direction of the springs; if so, the injunction
over the doorway, to "Remember Lot's wife," seems a strange rebuke, if intended for the inhabitants.
The building has many features of interest, the Norman, the Transition, and subsequent styles
of architectural decoration being observable.

The old town has an interesting charity, founded by Lord Coventry, for the support of poor
people, and the education of poor children.  The almshouses, which have recently been rebuilt,
and are eighteen in number, are commodious and convenient, with garden plots at the back; whilst
the inmates have 3s. 6d. per week, or 5s. if upwards of 70 years of age, beside clothing.
