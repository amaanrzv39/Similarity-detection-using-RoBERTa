This is a gratuitous insult, either pseudo-Christian nor ecclesiastical Jehovite idea of God.

    Hence the common ideal conception of "Immortality" is not only essentially wrong, but a physical and metaphysical impossibility. The idea,
is a chimerical illusion, whether it is liked by  Theosophists or non-Theosophists, by Christians or Spiritualists, by Materialists or Idealists. 

     But the actual prolongation of human life is possible to at most a couple of hundred years. It may appear miraculous and incredible to those who regard our span of existence as necessarily limited.
We may break, as it were, the shock of Death, and instead of dying, change a sudden plunge into darkness to a transition into a brighter light.
