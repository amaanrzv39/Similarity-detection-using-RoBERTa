Some one is with him--a lady. Yes, just as she thought, Clara Rutland. Here they come. She,
so--so--almost ugly, and he, so--so--so Jerome-like. That's the only way to express it. Jerome
is more than simply handsome, more than merely graceful, more than a man among men--he's a
non-such, in a nut-shell!

But here he is, almost in speaking distance, and every step bringing him nearer. Isn't he going
to be surprised? Isn't he going to be delighted? Isn't he going to shake her hand and smile
that impenetrable smile, and--?

How is this? Jerome has come and gone. He did not look at her--he did not once raise his eyes
in passing.

Just ahead of this poky little vehicle, where Mell awaited the return of Miss Josey, stood
a lordly equipage, all silver plate and shine, with a well-dressed groom standing in front
of the champing, restive, mettlesome animal, as eager to be off and gone somewhere as the most
restless of human hearts in a human bosom.

Into this nobby turnout Jerome assisted Miss Rutland, and then springing in himself, grasped
the reins from the groom's hands. For one awful moment (to Mell) the horse stood straight upon
his hind legs, and then, obeying Jerome's voice, who said in the quietest of tones, 'Go on,
Rhesus,' gave one wild plunge and dashed ahead, leaving Mell with a stifled feeling, as if
she was buried alive under twenty feet of volcanic ashes.

But what did it mean--his passing her without a sign of recognition? Jerome might be of a truant
disposition, of unstable fancy, and superior in his own strength to most ordinary rules, but
he couldn't help knowing her face to face.
