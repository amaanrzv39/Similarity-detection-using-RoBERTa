Conquer them first,' has been the glorious war-cry
from millions of the freest men on earth. But when we are driving a nail it is well to know
that it will be possible to eventually clench it. And when the country shall fully understand
the ease with which this Union nail may be clenched, there will be, let us hope, a greatly
revived spirit in all now interested in forwarding the war.

It is evident enough that if all the millions of the South remain united to the death in the
cause of secession, little else than a guerilla warfare of endless length is to be hoped for.
The accounts of the enthusiasm and harmony at present prevailing in Eastern Virginia, and in
other places controlled by the active secessionists, have struck terror to the hearts of many.
