And because it sees the hardship of being in dirt and not defiled, it longs with breathless passion and burning charity to free itself by one act from the world so far as possible. If unable to escape, it wishes to be perfect in its place. At least, it does not lack desire.

Then, we shall awaken, and no longer sleep. Open the mind's eye to faith, to know, to love, to follow that truth which you will know through the Blood of the humble and loving Lamb. You will know that Blood in the knowledge of yourself, that the face of your soul may be washed there. And it is ours, and none can take it from us unless we choose.
