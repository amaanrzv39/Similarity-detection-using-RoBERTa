And
shall I find myself thus every time, in every place, and in every state? Shall I always close
with my faithlessness the way to Thy providence? Yes, truly, if indeed Thou by Thy mercy do
not unmake me, and make me anew. Then, Lord, unmake me, and break the hardness of my heart,
that I be not a tool which spoils Thy works!

And I beg you, dearest father, to pray earnestly that I and you both together may drown ourselves
in the Blood of the humble Lamb, which will make us strong and faithful.
