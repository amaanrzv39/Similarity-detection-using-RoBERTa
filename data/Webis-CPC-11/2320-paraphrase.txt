After church, I thank you and God are not like other men. Live and speak as if you live forever. If you have tens of thousands gathered to try to make hundreds of thousands. Why retire and make way for the industry of others, then you will be able to hold more.

Give credit, take credit, live on credit, if you are rich, your money is to be simultaneously the interests of justice. If you are poor, you have no other way of living.

In business any favors.
