After a few days, the preparations necessary for an assault were complete and late that evening the column marched forward. As the column departed an courier rode up at full speed with dispatches from Potemkin. Suwarrow upon learning of the couriers arrival intuitively knew the nature of the dispatches, and decided to ignore them until the fate of the enterprise was decided. He ordered his men to fetch his horse and galloped away. 

The Turks fought valiantly but were ultimately defeated, and Ismail fell into the hands of the Russians. 

As Suwarrow's staff praised their leader , the eyes of the Marshal fell upon the courier with the dispatches from Potemkin.

"Who are you, brother?" said he.

"It is I," replied the courier, "who brought dispatches from Prince Potemkin yesterday evening."

"Ahah!" exclaimed Suwarrow, with affected passion,"you bring me news from my sovereign!

Suwarrow handed the dispatch to one of his generals and bade him read it aloud.

There was deep silence as the dispatch was opened. Suwarrow and his victorious company listened intently as the general proceeded to speak every danger which they had courageously overcome.
