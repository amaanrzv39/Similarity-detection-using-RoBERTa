The reader will remember that Adelaide, wife of Welter, or Lord Ascot, broke her back while
attempting to jump a fence, mounted on the back of the Irish mare 'Molly Asthore,' but the
reader does not know that Welter was the cause of his wife's fall, and that he actually hired
a groom to scare 'Molly Asthore' so that she would take the fence, and also his wife out of
this vale of tears. (This sentence I know is not grammatical; who cares?) Welter, when he saw
that his wife was not killed, was furious. His large red brutal face turned to purple; he smote
his prize-fighting chest with his huge fists, he lowered his eyebrows until he resembled an
infuriated hog, and then he retired to his house and drank a small box of claret--pints--twenty-four
to the dozen!
