I asked him how come he always called that girl Lucie, since her name was Marie. He looked all surprised, and he said he never knew her, because he'd never been over to Alphonse's place, and he repeated the story later, as if he'd picked it up from the women who dropped by the Rat Mort at midnight for a late supper.  He told me he was sorry he didn't know me when he wrote it, because I could have done a better job telling the story than those chicks who hung out at the Rat Mort, giving him details the girls hadn't noticed, or had forgotten.
