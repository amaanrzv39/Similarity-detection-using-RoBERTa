Besides this work there is each January for two weeks at Tuskegee the regular Farmers' Short
Course. Many of the country schools adjourn for this period so that both teachers and pupils
may attend. In this course not only teachers and pupils, but fathers and mothers, sons and
daughters sit side by side in the classrooms receiving instruction in stock raising, canning,
poultry raising, and farming in all its branches. There are special courses for the women and
girls in the care of children and in housekeeping.
