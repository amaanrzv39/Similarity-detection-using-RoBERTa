To prserve your wort from foxing  you must put a handful of or two hops to the malt into the underback before you leting it into wort. 
     When you boil your Worts try to boil the first wort quickly so that the following worts will boil more than the first one. 
      At the time of cooling also extreme care should be given.Lay  the worts thin so that each will be cooled.After that let the worts slowly down to the Tun till the end  as little of the feces or sediments increase or decrease theintensity of  fermentation. Salt and sulphu should be accurate in proportion. All these make athe art of brewing.
              Add a little yeast to the Tun and let it work . If the yeast work slowly whip in the yeast two times or more, because full opening of the body of fermentation will only make the drink clean and light.
         when you cleanse ,do it by a cock and it should be six inches from the bottom of the Tun so that the sediments may left behind  and you can throw in to your Malt to mend  small beert
