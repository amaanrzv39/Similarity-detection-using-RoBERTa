There are wonderful flowers growing along the slopes above Prato, and the beauty of the village is rich for sketching, but to me, the church was the absolute best thing, the way it stood, and the beautiful covered porch entrance. There is no glamour to this porch from the outside, but from within the porch I made two sketches. Also there is a half completed fresco of St. George and the Dragon, most likely of the fifteenth century, and surely with much feeling.
The church has very little inside that is modern and newer than the tower. The tower is nice, and the only tower being second in Leventina to the tower of Quinto, which, might I add is not not placed quite as well.

The Prato people share the same fondness for cherries as the people of Primadengo, although there were no men in the trees to be seen.
