But he remembered York when adding to
their title that they were "newly composed for the northern part of this Kingdom." This first
edition contained fifty-four characters, which precede the others in the following collection.
In the next year, 1629, the book reached a fifth edition, printed for Robert Allot, in which
the number of the characters was increased to seventy-six. Two more characters--a Herald, and
a Suspicious or Jealous Man--were added in the sixth edition, which was printed for Allot in
1633. The seventh edition was printed for Andrew Coolie in 1638, the eighth in 1650. Other
editions followed in 1669, 1676, 1732, and at Salisbury in 1786. In 1811 the little book was
edited carefully by Dr. Philip Bliss, and it was edited again by Professor Edward Arber in
1868, in his valuable series of English Reprints.

John Earle, after the production of his "Microcosmography," wrote in April 1630 a short poem
upon the death of William, third Earl of Pembroke, son of Sidney's sister. The third Earl's
younger brother Philip succeeded as fourth Earl, and was Chancellor of the University of Oxford.
He was then, or thereafter became, Earle's patron, and made him his chaplain. About the same
time, in 1631, Earle acted as proctor of the University. In 1639 the Earl of Pembroke presented
John Earle to the living of Bishopston in Wiltshire, as successor to Chillingworth.
