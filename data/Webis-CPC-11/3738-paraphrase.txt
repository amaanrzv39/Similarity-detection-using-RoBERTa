Do not make any comments either in a competition (this is certainly the worst of all) or a normal game. Do not argue, unless the sticks. Remember that Beau-swordsman ideal is one which is struggling hard with "silent lips and striking his hand."

COMPETITIONS.

Once a man has mastered the rudiments of any game and gained a considerable amount of dexterity in "playing loose", he begins to long to be pitted against one in order to measure strength. Before long the limits of its gymnasium to grow too small for his ambition, and then is that we can expect to find him looking round for a chance to win substantial laurels in public competitions. Unfortunately, stick player will not find many opportunities to display his skill in public. Regarding the present writer knows, there are only two awards given each year in London for a single stick, and none of these attract much attention. One of them is given to military tour of Islington, in June, and one of the German Gymnasium in December. Former these awards is open only to soldiers, militia-men, or volunteers, the latter in any respectable member of a sports club, which is prepared to pay 2s. 6d. for his entry fee. Attendance of spectators at both shows is very poor, which is to be regretted that the public interest generally, any game goes a long way to ensuring improvement in the game.

It is as well, before going to any of these competitions, to know something about the conditions under which they occur, and rules that govern them. Bouts are usually played in a fourteen foot ring, at least, that is when the players notice, and is equally well be prepared to limit your movements to such a limited area.
