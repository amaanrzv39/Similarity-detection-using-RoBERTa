And thus,
this impious war has brought out all the virtues of our race, both those with which we were
credited--of initiative, Ã©lan, bravery, and fearlessness--and those which we were not supposed
to possess--endurance, patience, and stoicism.

Let us do honor to all these heroes. Glory to those who have fallen before the victory, and
to those also who through it will avenge them tomorrow! A nation which can arouse such enthusiasm
can never perish.
