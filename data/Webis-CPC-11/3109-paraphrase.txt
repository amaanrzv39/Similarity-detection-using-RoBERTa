Within four quarter of an hour came the Judges, presently his Majesty, who spoke excellently well, and majestically, without hindrance in the least when they spoke. I saw the silver top of his staff unexpectedly fall to the ground, which was took up by Mr. Rushworth: and then I heard Bradshaw the Judge say to his Majesty,
'Sir, in lieu of answering the court, you interrogate their power, which becomes not four in your condition'--

These words pierced my heart and soul, to listen to a subject thus audaciously to reprehend his Sovereign, who ever and anon replied with great magnanimity and prudence.

After that his Majesty was beheaded, the Parliament for some years effected nothing either for the publick peace or tranquillity of the nation, or settling religion as they had formerly promised.
