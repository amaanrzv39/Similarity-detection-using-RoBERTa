him his due, invariably cordial to me--in fact, he seems to seek and to enjoy my company--but
when I think of him as a favored guest at your father's house while I'm prohibited from entering
its doors, and while you, my betrothed wife, beg me not to come near the house, is it any wonder
I am harassed? He was at Oaklands again yesterday, was he not?"

"Yes, he was; but that is of no moment," Betty answered frankly.
