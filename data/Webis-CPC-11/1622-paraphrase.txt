Unless someone was in trouble, anyone could enjoy the trip we took on the water.  We were definitely glad to be safe and getting closer to home, but it was hard to relax and have a good time just because we were thinking so much.  We hopped on a train in Owen Sound and took it all the way to Parkdale which is right outside of Toronto.  After a while, I decided to go home and took off at 9pm.
