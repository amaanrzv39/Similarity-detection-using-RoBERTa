An author is too close to his own work to see it clearly enough judge it fairly, especially when it comes to seeing its flaws.  That is why evaluation from fresh eyes is so important, and why it is imperative to take feedback  seriously, even harsh criticism.  However painful it is to hear, the opportunity to correct errors in my work is something that is important to me, and something any writer should embrace.

But as much as I appreciate criticism and the opportunity to improve my work, and am willing to listen to harsh feedback to that end, Dr. Lightfoot has stepped over the line in his Decenber essay on Supernatural Religion in the "Contemporary Review".
