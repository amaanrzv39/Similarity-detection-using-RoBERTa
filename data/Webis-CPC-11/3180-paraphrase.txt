We are taught to be scared of the Eternal Being and the King and not socialize with people who want to change too much.

In reference to a non-Israelite ruler, the prophets say, 'Do what the King of Babylon says and you will stay alive.' They also say to 'Pray that we find the city where God will keep us captivated.'  Besides joyfully testifying for God, we need to show our loyalty through our actions of being kind to others.  We must never, even in our thoughts, doubt God.  We must take His wants as unbreakable law.
