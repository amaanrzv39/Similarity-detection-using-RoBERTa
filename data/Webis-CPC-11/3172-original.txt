He has much of honour according
to the original sense of it, which among the ancients, Gellius says, signified injury. His
prosperity was greater than his brain could bear, and he is drunk with it; and if he should
take a nap as long as Epimenides or the Seven Sleepers he would never be sober again. He took
his degree and went forth lord by mandamus, without performing exercises of merit. His honour's
but an immunity from worth, and his nobility a dispensation for doing things ignoble. He expects
that men's hats should fly off before him like a storm, and not presume to stand in the way
of his prospect, which is always over their heads. All the advantage he has is but to go before
or sit before, in which his nether parts take place of his upper, that continue still, in comparison,
but commoners.
