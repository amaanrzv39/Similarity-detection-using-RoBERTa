"I am afraid so," answered Pierre painfully.  "But we shall see."  Then early teaching came
to him, never to be entirely obliterated, and he added: "Has the child been baptised?"

The old man shook his head.  "'Will you do it?" asked Pierre hesitatingly.

"I can't--I can't," was the reply.

Pierre smiled a little ironically, as if at himself, got some water in a cup, came over, and
said: "Remember, I'm a Papist!"
