Naturally, it's just like a man.

Men worry about making mistakes along the line, so they often exaggerate polliteness.  Such was the case with a Red Cross major in France who knew nothing about military matters and wasn't arrogant at all.  So he saluted all the privates and the M.P's before they could salute him.  He was often just asking directions or something, and they were left standing and staring as he went down the road.
