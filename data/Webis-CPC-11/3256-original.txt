"Delighted" (Vol. ii., p. 113.).--I incline to think that the word delighted in Shakspeare
represents the Latin participle delectus (from deligere), "select, choice, exquisite, refined."
This sense will suit all the passages cited by MR. HICKSON, and particularly the last. If this
be so, the suggested derivations from the adjective light, and from the substantive light,
fall to the ground: but MR. HICKSON will have been right in distinguishing Shakspeare's delighted
from the participle of the usual verb to delight, delectare=gratify. The roots of the two are
distinct: that of the former being leg-ere "to choose;" of the latter, lac-ere "to tice."

Meaning of the Word "Delighted."--I am not the only one of your readers who have read with
deep interest the important contributions of MR. HICKSON, and who hope for further remarks
on Shakspearian difficulties from the same pen. His papers on the Taming of the Shrew were
of special value; and although I do not quite agree with all he has said on the subject, there
can be no doubt of the great utility of permitting the discussion of questions of the kind
in such able hands.

Perhaps you would kindly allow me to say thus much; for the remembrance of the papers just
alluded to renders a necessary protest against that gentleman's observations on the meaning
of the word delighted somewhat gentler.
