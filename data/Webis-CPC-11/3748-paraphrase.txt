He was surprised by one. It was just after dark on the road coming from Milianca and asked to induce the Caid from the adjoining tribe to start up a battle when we got back.Talking about the vast number of wild boars he could set a hunter's heart jump in his chest.When we went to bed in a shelter built to keep the cold away I slept as deep as a tired traveller could.

Hoping to get some reliable information on how good the hunting was I consulted in the Caid's lieutenant who was a handsome man. I was thrilled to learn his name was Abd-el-Kader, a man with the famous name as the chief but was no relation. He told us a long story of how he had captured a boar that some Arabs had wounded by catching it by the hoofs muzzled it and took it home alive.He also told us the story of being surprised by a lion as he was coming back from Milianah at dusk.There was lots of lions in the area and he promised us a lion hunt with his friend the Caid on our trip back.

Abd-el-Kader accompanied us showing us a short cut over the mountains to the caravanserai of Oued-el-Massin where we would spend the night and would find our luggage. We had expected to find the river running high and we were not disappointed. Abd-el-Kader wanted me to wait on the bank while he went into the water to see if he could get through.He came back and asked if I had a good horse and would I follow him.When I said yes he told me to watch the opposite shore and not to look at the water because as rough as it was I would be washed away and drowned.
