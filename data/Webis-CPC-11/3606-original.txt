I was especially successful in my treatment of similar sufferings, for which I
had discovered an anodyne that was almost specific.  I wrote on a leaf of my pocketbook a prescription
which I felt sure would be efficacious, and as I tore it out and placed it in his hand, I chanced
to look up, and saw the hazel eyes of my hostess fixed upon me with a kinder and softer expression
than they often condescended to admit into their cold and penetrating lustre.  At that moment,
however, her attention was drawn from me to a servant, who entered with a note, and I heard
him say, though in an undertone, "From Mrs. Ashleigh."

She opened the note, read it hastily, ordered the servant to wait without the door, retired
to her writing-table, which stood near the place at which I still lingered, rested her face
on her hand, and seemed musing. Her meditation was very soon over.  She turned her head, and
to my surprise, beckoned to me.  I approached.

"Sit here," she whispered: "turn your back towards those people, who are no doubt watching
us.  Read this."

She placed in my hand the note she had just received.  It contained but a few words, to this
effect:--

   DEAR MARGARET,--I am so distressed.  Since I wrote to you a few
   hours ago, Lilian is taken suddenly ill, and I fear seriously.  What
   medical man should I send for?  Let my servant have his name and
   address.

                                                    A.  A.

I sprang from my seat.

"Stay," said Mrs. Poyntz.  "Would you much care if I sent the servant to Dr. Jones?"

"Ah, madam, you are cruel!  What have I done that you should become my enemy?"

"Enemy!  No.  You have just befriended one of my friends.  In this world of fools intellect
should ally itself with intellect.
