One story that has been told of her that reveals much about her character is this: she left from her house early in the morning, saying that she would be back in time for dinner.  When she arrived at the neighbor's house, the neighbor was not there, but she asked to be shown the neighbor's library.  She became so caught up in her reading that she stayed the whole day without realizing it, only coming to her senses when the dark crept into the room.
