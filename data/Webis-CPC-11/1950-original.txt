As a
result of the protective tariff, Southern planters were compelled to turn more and more to
Northern mills for their cloth, shoes, hats, hoes, plows, and machinery. Nearly all the goods
which they bought in Europe in exchange for their produce came overseas to Northern ports,
whence transshipments were made by rail and water to Southern points of distribution. Their
rice, cotton, and tobacco, in as far as they were not carried to Europe in British bottoms,
were transported by Northern masters.
