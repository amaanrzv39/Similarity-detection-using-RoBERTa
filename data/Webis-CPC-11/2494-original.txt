The pain generally is very great; paralysis of the
nerve of sight may occur, and death may be caused by the abscess extending to the brain.

Treatment.--The treatment for either orbital or periorbital abscess is the same as that for
abscess occurring in any other part of the body--a free opening for the escape of imprisoned
pus. This should be made as soon as the true nature of the disease is recognized. Afterwards
antiseptic injections may be needed to stimulate healthy granulation and to prevent septic
infection of the ocular membranes. For this purpose a saturated solution of boric acid or listerine
1 part to 10 of water may be used. When the fever runs high, Glauber's salt (sulphate of soda)
may be given in 4-ounce doses once a day.
