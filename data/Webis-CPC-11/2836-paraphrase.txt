Holcroft was a reasoner and a doctrinaire. He believed in the ideals of rectitude, courage, and unflinching truth. He thought for himself, but he could not assimilate the ideas of other men. He had in himself, the untamed volcanic emotions that is often associated with the heroes of the romantic novels of that age. Holcroft believed in the almost limitless power of the human mind. His own career was an example, with his rise from being the stable-boy to the cobbler to now the dramatist. That itself was a monument of the human will power.

The progressives of that generation were tempted to think that perfection was well within their reach if their youth had not been stunted by the influence of Calvin and the British Constitution.
