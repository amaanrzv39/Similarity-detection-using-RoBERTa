Tullia - Excuse me! Do you mean to tell me that we are not the ruling elite of this planet, as we have believed ourselves to be, but are only 50% owners? I'm embarrassed to think how this makes us look.

The Savant - (annoyed that Tullia has criticized his poetry, answers her sarcastically:)
Indeed, your fellow patriots who have been bragging that they are self-made rulers of the earth, barely control one fifth of it. Right now, those of us who live in Eastern Europe, run an empire that is vaster than Roman territory. On top of that, it is run by a woman, who is far smarter and more beautiful than you, and who wears dresses; if she had read my poetry, I know she would have given them a good review.

(The Marchioness tells the author to shut up, since the woman he is disrespecting is the daughter of Cicero, and a Roman lady.)
