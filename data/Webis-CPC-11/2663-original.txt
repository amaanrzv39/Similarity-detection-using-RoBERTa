I hurried along as fast as possible in order to traverse the 2 miles of highroad and the other
of woodland track, which lay before me, ere night fell. In spite of the 30 miles already done
that day my legs continued to serve me well and I walked rapidly on with a bent head, full
of thought.

At a sudden turning of the path I raised my eyes to scrutinize the way. About 50 yards in front
of me I saw a dark and confused mass slowly moving. Thinking to meet with a party of coolies
from a neighbouring mine, who were perhaps going for provisions, I advanced for another 40
paces, then stopped short and was fixed to the spot. The formless mass had taken the shape
of nothing less than an enormous tiger!
