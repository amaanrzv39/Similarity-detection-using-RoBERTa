It would, for example,
be easier for us to produce a Sophocles, or an Euripides, than such individuals as your father,
because, theatres we have, but no tribunals for public harangues.[6] You have hissed the tragedy
of Cataline; when you shall see Phaedrus played, you will probably agree that the part of Phaedrus,
in Racine, is infinitely superior to the model you have known in Euripides. I hope, also, that
you will agree our Moli√®re surpasses your Terence.
