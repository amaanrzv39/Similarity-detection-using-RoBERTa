It has in the course of time been forgotten, but still
exists somewhere in the subconsciousness or memory.  This forgetting has been brought about
by a process of dissociation from the original exciting cause. But the writer will not agree
that this dissociation has been, of necessity, brought about by psychic repression on the part
of the individual, that by psychoanalysis the condition can be traced back to the sexual activities
or tendencies of infantile or early childhood origin, or that the condition may be cured when
the original cause is made known to the patient through psychoanalysis, without the training
of the will so necessary in this condition.

Thus the analytic tendency of the Freudian school is to be highly commended.
