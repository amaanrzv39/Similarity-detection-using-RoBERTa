I cannot regret the loss of a slight
and superficial essay, for such the work must have been in the hands of a stranger, uninformed
by the scholars and statesmen, and remote from the libraries and archives of the Swiss republics.
My ancient habits, and the presence of Deyverdun, encouraged me to write in French for the
continent of Europe; but I was conscious myself that my style, above prose and below poetry,
degenerated into a verbose and turgid declamation.
