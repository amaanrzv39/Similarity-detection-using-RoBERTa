In September 1851, a circular was issued by the president of the Norfolk Agricultural Society.  It was at a meeting of delegates from the agricultural societies in the State where he made efforts to establish the Massachusetts Central Board of Agriculture.  He was in office till 1852, the time that it became a department of the State and then he is the senior member or that board.  Again in 1858, he became president of Massachusetts School of Agriculture.  But before the school was opened, the Congress granted land to several States for agricultural colleges.  Then in 1865, the Legislature incorporated the Massachusetts Agricultural College.
