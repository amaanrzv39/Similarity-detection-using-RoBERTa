As good fortune would have it, he fell in with an Irishman as thoughtless as
himself, and whose plight so exactly resembled his own, that, such is the sympathetic power
of misfortune, they formed a mutual attachment almost as soon as they came in contact. Both
were pedestrians bound to London, and both were equally destitute of money or friends; and
one honest mode only remained for them to pursue, which was, to address themselves to "the
charitable and humane." This point being settled, it was agreed to take their turn in begging
along the road; and in this manner they reached London, without having any reason to complain
of neglect, or that there was any lack of generous and disinterested feeling in the human species.
