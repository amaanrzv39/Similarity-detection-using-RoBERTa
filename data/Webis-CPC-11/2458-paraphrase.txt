The skulls of most Negroes are high and narrow.  Welcker observes that the average percentage begins at 68 and rises to 78.  Barnard Davis discovered four brachyrephals, only from eighteen heads from Equatorial Africa and thus the variations are so well pronounced.  Dolichocephalism is combined with a protrusion of the upper jaw and an sloping position of the teeth in majority of the cases. Nonetheless there are whole nations which are truly mesognathous.  The implication that the negro was the ideal of everything barbarous and beast like in nature by certain mistaken ethnologists, is to be regretted. They attempted to deny the negro any chance of putting his ability to improve, and even denies his position as a man.
