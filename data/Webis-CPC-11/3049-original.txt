Captain Wickham did not remark any above the entrance of the river he explored,
on the western side of the bay, which bears out the opinion I have above expressed. A curious
fact, mentioned by Mr. Clarke is, that one piece, perfectly water-worn, was found upon a high
mountain, full twenty-five miles inland from the mouth of Clarence River. Was this carried
thither by one of the natives, or does it indicate that pumice drifted to this part of the
continent at a time when, if ever, it was on a level with the ocean? I further remarked in
this place, many of the land shells common to this and other parts of the coast.

There was great difficulty in attaining the loftiest point of the Cape, which I found to be
two thousand feet high.
