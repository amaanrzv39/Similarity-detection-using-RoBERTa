Remember that God's Lovingkindness and Salvation are dear to us.  Know that you need nothing else.  That knowledge gives the utmost pleasure to God and to me.  Rise up my sweet daughters, and put your own wills beneath that of God.  You must grow strong, so that you may give up the milk of babyhood and be able to chew the hard crusts of adult bread which you need to thrive.

That is all I have to impart.  Hold to the dear sinews of love in order to demonstrate that you are true and faithful daughters.
