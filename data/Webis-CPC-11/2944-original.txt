Now the strings produce the latter with ease, but the wind instruments, particularly the wood
winds do not. It is almost impossible to get a delicately sustained piano from wind instruments.

The players, flautists particularly, have transformed their formerly delicate instruments into
formidable tubes (Gewaltsrohren). French oboists, who have preserved the pastoral character
of their instrument, and our clarinetists, when they make use of the "Echo effect," are the
exceptions.

This drawback, which exists in our best orchestras, suggests the question: why, at least, do
not conductors try to equalise matters by demanding a somewhat fuller piano from the strings?
But the conductors do not seem to notice any discrepancy.
