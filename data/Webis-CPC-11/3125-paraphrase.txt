The suggestions were not complete for illustrations in the later books, and did not show, in all cases, with adequatae sureness to permit them to be carried out, the changes from the customary plans and strategies purposed by the translator. It has, however, been chosed to include into this piece of work only illustrations that have been approved by Professor Morgan. The only exception to this rule is the rough model reprint of the Ram of Hegetor,created by me based on measurings given by Vitruvius ans Athenaeus.
