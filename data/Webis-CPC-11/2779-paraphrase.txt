The natives weren't supposed to sustain a loss greater than on the former occasion, but the results lasted longer and were seared more painfully into memory. Three colonists manning the guns on the eastern post were injured. Gardiner and Crook were dangerously hurt, and Tines succumbed to his wounds. Although three bullets penetrated the Agent's clothes, he fortunately escaped unharmed.

In this period, surgical knowledge was scarce and rudimentary, with little skill and no instruments available at the settlement. While James's powders and febrifuges were widely available, there were no provisions for broken bones and removing shards of metal from injured limbs.
