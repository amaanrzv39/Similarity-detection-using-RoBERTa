The Castle occupies
the plain of a rocky hill that rises abruptly from the meadows. The building is of great extent,
and, from its elevated situation, it is a landmark for the surrounding country.

Bolsover has been the site of a castle from the Norman Conquest to the present time; but, of
the first fabric of this description not a single vestige now remains. At the Domesday survey
it belonged to William Peveril, lord of Derbyshire, in whose family it remained for three generations.
