The fire happened on the 9th of June, and as the houses
of the town were mostly built of wood, it soon spread beyond the power of any efforts which
the population could command to restrain it. The Custom-house, Roman Catholic Church, Protestant
Episcopal Cathedral, Court-house, jail, ordnance store, all the newspaper and printing-offices,
the banks, the Hall of Legislature, post-office, and police-office, were all burnt clown, together
with two whole streets, each more than a mile long, leaving 12,000 persons without a habitation.
