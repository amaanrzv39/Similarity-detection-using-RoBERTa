The frog, after similar feats of gluttony, is cut open by a barber, who, while shaving
it, thinks that it looks very fat; and its victims also emerge uninjured.

There are many tales now current in different parts of Europe, but chiefly in the south and
east, which turn upon the relations existing between human beings and their fates: each person
being supposed to have a special fate or fortune, a species of guardian demon, upon whose good
will all his or her success in life depends. It is very doubtful whether such stories are products
of European fancy, their leading ideas seeming to be little in keeping with the religious beliefs--whether
of classic times, or of Teutonic, Slavic, or Celtic antiquity--respecting either an overruling
destiny, or a triad of Fates or Norns.
