The door on the south
side is simple, but remarkably beautiful.  It looks almost as if it might belong to some early
Norman church in England, and the stones have acquired a most exquisite warm colour with age.
At Ispra there is a campanile which Mr. Ruskin would probably disapprove of, but which we thought
lovely.  A few kilometres further on a corner is turned, and the splendid castle of Angera
is caught sight of.

Before going up to the castle we stayed at the inn on the left immediately on entering the
town, to dine.
