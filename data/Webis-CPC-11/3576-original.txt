Some time after this Mrs. Sheen was showing General Dalton's house to friends who had been
living abroad and wanted a home. The two ladies had been through the lower floors and started
to the third story. At the top of the steps the visitor said, "I can't go farther. Something
is pushing me back." Mrs. Sheen at once descended the stairs, thinking her friend ill. When
they reached the first floor the lady from abroad said, "A force was pushing me backward. I
am quite psychic, you know, and the ghost who inhabits this house would make it impossible
for me to live here. I love the house and should like to own it, but I should not be permitted
to do so."

At the second auction of lots held on July 14, 1749, Augustine Washington, brother of Lawrence
Washington and half-brother of George, bought lots Nos. 64 and 65 for fifteen pistoles. At
a meeting of the trustees on June 15, 1754, lots Nos. 64 and 65, the property of Augustine
Washington, along with other lots were ordered to "be sold to the highest bidder at a Public
Vendue, the several Proprietors thereof having failed to build thereon according to the directions
of the Act of Assembly in that case made and provided and it is further ordered that the Clerk
do give Public Notice that the sale of the said lotts will be at the Town aforesaid on the
first day of August next."[112] In the minutes of the trustees for September 9, 1754, lots
Nos. 64 and 65 were entered as sold to William Ramsay for 39-1/2 pistoles, or Â£37 1s. 9d.
