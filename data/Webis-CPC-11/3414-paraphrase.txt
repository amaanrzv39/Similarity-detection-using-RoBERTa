Portrait of Baretti (Vol. VIII., P. 411 .).-- In reply to MR. Consultation Corner photo GR Sir Joshua Reynolds Baretti, I can give you the information you need.

This portrait is very interesting because my brother, Holland House, Kensington.

My late father, Lord Holland, had a nice picture of the mother of the late Lord Hertford (maybe), or a close family member. Not be connected with that family, my father offered it to Lord Hertford, leaving his lordship to give him the picture, as he might choose to change. Some time after this portrait of Baretti was sent, and was well liked and admired. Baretti represents reading a small book, which is near his face with both hands, it is in a white coat, and everything carries certain similarity. This happened about twenty years. Perhaps it may interest readers to know that our distinguished (478) painter, Watts, painted by my brother Lord Holland, a portrait of another distinguished Italian, Mr. Panizzi, and the first suspension. He is represented leaning forward and writing, and the resemblance is very striking.
