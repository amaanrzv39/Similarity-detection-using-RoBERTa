The first notice of this editis in the Catalogue Bolongaro-Crevenna (Amst. 1789), where it is said to have 52 printed leaves. You can see it from the price list printed after the sale in 1790 that it wasn't sold, but was retenu, faute de commissions ou de concurrence," and could still be obtained at 15 florins. There was no trace of it found since. Panzer and Hain were therefore able to copy the catalogue description. Philippe (1885) described Heynlin's copy, which is help by the University of Basel library, as being only a blank leaf, 49 printed leaves and the end having two more blank leaves.
