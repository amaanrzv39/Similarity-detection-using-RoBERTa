The impropriation of this town of Diseworth was formerly the inheritance of three sisters,
whereof two became votaries; one in the nunnery of Langly in the parish of Diseworth, valued
at the suppression, I mean the whole nunnery, at thirty-two pounds per annum, and this sister's
part is yet enjoyed by the family of the Grayes, who now, and for some years past, have the
enjoyment and possession of all the lands formerly belonging to the nunnery in the parish of
Diseworth, and are at present of the yearly value of three hundred and fifty pounds per annum.
One of the sisters gave her part of the great tithes unto a religious house in Bredon upon
the Hill; and, as the inhabitants report, became a religious person afterwards.

The third sister married, and her part of the tithes in succeeding ages became the Earl of
Huntingdon's, who not many years since sold it to one of his servants.

The donation of the vicarage is in the gift of the Grayes of Langley, unto whom they pay yearly,
(I mean unto the Vicar) as I am informed, six pounds per annum. Very lately some charitable
citizens have purchased one-third portion of the tithes, and given it for a maintenance of
a preaching minister, and it is now of the value of about fifty pounds per annum.

There have been two hermitages in this parish; the last hermit was well remembered by one Thomas
Cooke, a very ancient inhabitant, who in my younger years acquainted me therewith.

This town of Diseworth is divided into three parishes; one part belongs under Locington, in
which part standeth my father's house, over-against the west end of the steeple, in which I
was born: some other farms are in the parish of Bredon, the rest in the parish of Diseworth.
