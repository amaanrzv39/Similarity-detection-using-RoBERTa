He introduced them as Skye and a Yorkshire terrier. Skye had a lethargic aire, relaxing into the pocket with only a small portion of his face peering out.  The Yorkshire was the complete opposite, with boundless energy and sass, in his new Ulster coat of brown with a scarlet braid accent.

With full excitement, he started into Charley's pockets in search of a shilling.  When his search became futile, the gentlemen, noticing the Yorkshire's despair, offered his own pocket; which the terrier tore into enthusiastically and eventually emerged with a shiny shilling gripped firmly by his teeth. His purpose, according to his master, was to deliver the shilling to the cake shop where he would be rewarded by the baker with a cake. Then off he would trot,to comfortably fulfill his sweet tooth at home.
