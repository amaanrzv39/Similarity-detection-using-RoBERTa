With a burst of strength I freed myself from my constraints and removed the blindfold from my eyes. The only thing I could think of was stealing a weapon from the enemy and knocking him to the ground. I lept onto a horse, shouting a battle cry, "Saint George for Mandeville"! and fled away toward the Croats.

When asked who I represented, I replied "For Amalia and Kalbs-Kuchen," and was kindly welcomed as a hero.
