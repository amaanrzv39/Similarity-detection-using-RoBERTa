the top, at the opposite end, was a small flat piece like another oar blade, only broader and
shorter, fixed at such an angle that when she sat down upon it the carved piece stood up slant-wise

in her hand she held a bobbin on to which she wove the thread.

She was never idle, for, when not occupied in singing to us, she spent her time spinning, always
repeating, however, the second line of the other performers.
