(2) The presence of vestigial organs in the higher animals supplies another argument for the
belief in common descent. In man, for example, there exist over one hundred of these vestigial
or rudimentary organs, as the vermiform appendix, the pineal gland, and the like. Many of these
vestigal organs, which are now functionless in man, perform functions in lower animals, and
this is held to show that at some remote period in the past they also functioned in man's ancestors.

(3) The facts of embryology seem to point to the descent of the higher types of animals from
the lower types. The embryo or fetus in its development seems to recapitulate the various stages
through which the species has passed.
