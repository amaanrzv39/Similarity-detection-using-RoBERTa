So the finish of the comedy deserves the epithet "engaging" in more senses than one: with a
Jack to every Jill, and the harvest moon (as promised in the cover picture) beaming upon all,
the couples paired off to everyone's entire satisfaction. A tale that will be safe for a succ√®s
fou with all who have worn the smock and the green armlet; while I can well imagine that ladies
less fortunate may find their enjoyment of it tempered with a certain wistfulness.

German Days (MURRAY) is a plain tale of everyday life in Germany before the War, with just
those gaps in it which would naturally occur in the narrative of any one observer who also
hadn't been aware at the time that she was observing.
