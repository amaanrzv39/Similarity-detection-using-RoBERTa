Ha! ha! He little thought there
was one there who had not "enjoyed that privilege." Have enjoyed most privileges in my time,
but never that of "hearing myself as others hear me"--more or less. "Unavoidable absence of
Mr. GLADSTONE!" Ho! ho! Then my disguise was perfect. Get myself up as a Liberal Unionist,
with wig and eye-glass. Not likely anybody would recognise me in that rig.

Rather enjoyed myself--and my paper, "Phoenician Elements in the Homeric Poems." Most seductive
title! Such a popular touch about it! Think I shall have it printed as a "leaflet" for distribution
among Workmen's Clubs and Radical Associations. Might conciliate those well-meaning but illogical
Eight-Hour Men. Wonder if KEIRHARDIE would like a copy.
