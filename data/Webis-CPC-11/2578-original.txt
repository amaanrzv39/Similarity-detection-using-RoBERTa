"Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister
to them who shall be heirs of salvation?"

When parents cheerfully fall in with the great designs of God, and in dependence upon him in
the use of the divinely appointed means, in his preparing a people to himself, what a glorious
combination there is in all this to fulfill his gracious purposes. Not only God the Father,
God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, but the angelic hosts, and all good people by their prayers
and labors, help forward this grand and glorious design.

When beyond this sublunary sphere, and the vail is removed which now hides from our view the
realities of the unseen world, with what different emotions may we suppose parents will look
upon their mission on earth.
