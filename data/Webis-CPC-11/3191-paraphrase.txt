Crows--Witnessing a single crow in flight is a sign of bad luck.  If a single crow comes to rest, it is a sign of some fury being unleashed.

Owls--The screech of an owl is an awful sound.  They have been around since time began and yet we still cannot help but be startled by that sound.  As Chaucer wrote:

"The owl screeches to warn of the death of the body"

Sometimes the owl flies in the day, sometimes at night, but in either case, seeing an owl is a sign of bad luck.  But just as much as seeing an owl scares us, the sight also scares the small birds of the tees.

Cukoos--When you hear at the beginning of spring, rub a coin in your pocket and make a wish.
