The habit of being alternately
on these two thrones will never disgust you.

In Paris a few years ago people admired a rhinoceros. If there were in one province ten thousand
rhinoceroses, men would run after them only to kill them. But let there be a hundred thousand
beautiful women men will always run after them to ... honour them.

REASON

At the time when all France was mad about Law's system, and Law was controller-general, there
came to him in the presence of a great assembly a man who was always right, who always had
reason on his side. Said he to Law:

"Sir, you are the biggest madman, the biggest fool, or the biggest rogue who has yet appeared
among us; and that is saying a great deal: this is how I prove it. You have imagined that a
state's wealth can be increased tenfold with paper; but as this paper can represent only the
money that is representative of true wealth, the products of the land and industry, you should
have begun by giving us ten times more corn, wine, cloth, canvas, etc. That is not enough,
you must be sure of your market. But you make ten times as many notes as we have of silver
and commodities, therefore you are ten times more extravagant, or more inept, or more of a
rogue than all the comptrollers who have preceded you. This is how I prove my major."

Hardly had he started his major than he was conducted to Saint-Lazare.

When he came out of Saint-Lazare, where he studied much and strengthened his reason, he went
to Rome; he asked for a public audience of the Pope, on condition that he was not interrupted
in his harangue; and he spoke to the Pope in these terms:

"Holy Father, you are an antichrist and this is how I prove it to Your Holiness. I call antichrist
the man who does the contrary to what Christ did and commanded.
