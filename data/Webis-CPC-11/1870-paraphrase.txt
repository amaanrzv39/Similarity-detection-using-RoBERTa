The Bishop of Rome forgave everyone who participated in this charitable work.

The Pope in 1184, Lucius III, with support from the Emperor Frederic Barbarossa, enacted more stringent policies regarding heretics, in addition to the imperial ban against them.  Excommmunication was just the start of their punishment, for they were then given over to the secular government for what was called animadverio debita, or deserved punishment.
