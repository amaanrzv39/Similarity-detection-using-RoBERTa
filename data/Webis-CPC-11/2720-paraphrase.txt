It will be noticed that the application of two coats of white zinc paint, of two coats of red lead, of coal tar and plaster of Paris mixed, of kerosene oil, of rosin and tallow mixed, of fish oil and tallow mixed and put on hot, of verdigris, of carbolic acid, of coal tar and hydraulic cement, of Davis' patent insulating compound, of compressed carbolized paper, of anti-fouling paint, of the Thilmany process, and of "vulcanized fiber," have proved failures.

The only favorable results have been that oak piles cut in the month of January and driven with the bark on have rejected four or five years, or till the bark abrade or rubbed off, and that cypress piles, well charred, have rejected for nine years.
