The flanks of these mountains, however, were really of importance to the botanical motive of
the expedition. Along the side of the Camanti, where the yellow Garote leaked downward in a
rocky ravine, the Bolivians were again successful. They brought to Marcoy specimens of half
a dozen cinchonas, for him to sketch, analyze and decorate with Latin names. The colors of
two or three of these barks promised well, but the pearl of the collection was a specimen of
the genuine Calisaya, with its silver-gray envelope and leaf ribbed with carmine. This proud
discovery was a boon for science and for commerce. It threw a new light upon the geographical
locality of the most precious species of cinchona. It was incontestably the plant, and the
Bolivians appeared amazed rather than pleased to have discovered outside of their own country
a kind of bark proper only to Bolivia, and hardly known to overpass the northern extremity
of the valley of Apolobamba. This discovery would rehabilitate, in the European market, the
quinine-plants of Lower Peru, heretofore considered as inferior to those of Upper Peru and
Bolivia. The latter country has for some time secured the most favorable reputation for its
barks--a reputation ably sustained by the efforts of the company De la Paz, to whom the government
has long granted a monopoly. This reputation is based on the abundance in that country of two
species, the Cinchona calisaya and Boliviana, the best known and most valued in the market.
But for two valuable cinchonas possessed by Bolivia, Peru can show twenty, many of them excellent
in quality, and awaiting only the enterprise of the government and the natural exhaustion of
the forests to the south.
