Put four well-cleansed medium-sized leeks (cut up small), the outer parts of a head of celery
(chopped), a quart of water and 2 oz. unpolished Japan rice, into a pan and simmer for two
hours. Rub through wire sieve, return to pan, bring to the boil, and serve.

This soup is not so much nutritive as cleansing and antiseptic.

TASTE OR THEORY?

FRUIT AND THE OXALIC ACID BOGEY.

Many and varied are the creeds of Health Reformers, but all may be included within two main
camps. And the opposing battle-cries are Instinct versus Intellect, Taste versus Theory, à
priori versus à posteriori, Motives versus Purposes. Some overlapping and confusion of creed
may be found in both camps, but in the main one is filled with lovers of Nature, the other
with devotees of Science.

"We believe in simplicity," cries the Nature-lover from the meadow where he is taking a sun-bath;
"you are so complex, so artificial."

"We believe in being 'sensible,'" retorts the devotee of Science from the cabinet where he
is taking an electric light bath, "you are so extreme."

"Not extreme--consistent. Your treatment varies every month as the decrees of 'Science' change."

"But your treatment varies every minute as the wind and clouds change. I can keep mine constant
with mathematical accuracy, or vary the light to a nicety by pressing a button."

And so also is it with regard to diet.
