His courage and sang-froid
won the admiration of all. He was wounded, but he cared little for that; and shortly after
he was promoted to the rank of sub-lieutenant.

Gauthier was very intimate with Lieutenant Saussier, another hero who had gone through the
"baptism of fire" in Africa, and whose great valour and integrity have won for him the high
office he now holds.

These two soldiers were of the same metal: they were able to understand and appreciate each
other, and were almost inseparable.

One day during the siege of Sebastopol, Lieutenant Saussier said to his friend:--

"Gauthier, may I ask you a question?"

"Two questions, if you like."

"You won't think it mere curiosity?"

"Are we not friends, Saussier?"

"Yes, but perhaps this is a secret----"
