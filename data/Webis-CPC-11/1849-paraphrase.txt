George Washington was one of the first to change crops from tobacco to wheat.  He used the most modern mechanical equipment of his time. He had a large mill for the wheat.  He was a successful wheat farmer. He still had problems from the middlemen, as most farmers do. In 1767 he wrote a nine-page letter about Carlyle and Adam. This was becaues the bags of wheat were damaged. Also, they didn't pay him in a timely manner.
