The love he bore to his son was carried to enthusiasm. According to those
persons who had access to his society at St. Helena, his young heir was the continual object
of his solicitude during the period of seven years, "For him alone," he said, "I returned from
the Island of Elba, and if I still form some expectations on earth, they are also for him."
He has declared to several of his suite, that he every day suffered the greatest anxiety on
his account.
