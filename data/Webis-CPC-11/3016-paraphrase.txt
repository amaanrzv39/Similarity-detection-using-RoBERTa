To the mind every thought that is received is brought about by one of these things or another. By only the sense of smell thoughts of odor are brought about; by tast thoughts of flavor; by just the eye thoughts of color. We posess no insight into these matters. No ideas were brought into this world when we entered into it. Within all of these matters we are merely creatures of education. Basic or single ideas, like basic words, equal basic thoughts or truths, intensified ideas equal intensified thinking or truths. Moreover it comes that each thought derives from an accompanying truth. To choose not to believe this is equivalent to asserting that we can plainly see within a vacuum, and that where there is nothing we can see something.

Now I declare my first proposition, having already declared the basis in which all are agreed:

GOD IS A TRUE AND LIVING EXISTENCE.
