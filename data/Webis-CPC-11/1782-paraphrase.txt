In moonlight it should be amazing.

We moved fast, entered into a forest of chestnuts. The leaves were rustling and had taken a golden colour. Under the forest there was the village of San Fili. Our old cart was left there. In fron of us, there was a level road, that had been there since the time of the Romans. In this road the Visigoths have passed when they came to destroy Rome.
