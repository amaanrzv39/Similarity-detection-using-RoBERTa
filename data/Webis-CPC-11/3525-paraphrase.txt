That the book is entitled "De Secretis Artis et Naturae" comes as no surprise.  Roger Bacon was certain in his declarations that man would one day achieve flight.  He believed that he himself would be able to costruct a flying machine with enough hard work.  He had not planned to explosives for power, but thought that given the proper tool, a windlass worked by hand, with a large enough surface area, a man would be able to create sufficient movement to raise himself in the air.  He encouraged many distringuished inventors, including Peregrinus, in this quest.

It is surprising to note that Aquinis made many accurate predictions of modern scientific ideas.  "Nothing at all would ever be reduced to nothingness (nihil onmino in nihilum redigetur)" he concluded a course on Cosmology at the University of Paris.  He was teaching the indestructibility of matter;  that man could not destroy matter, and God would not.  He taught that the form of matter may change, but that the amount of material substances would always remain the same in the world.
