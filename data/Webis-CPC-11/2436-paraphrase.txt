I am not drawing up lots or plots of any kind of real estate-- Your Colonel Smith I have never even heard of. Thirdly, I completely and honestly swear by Nebuchadnezzar, Minos, Alianthus,Rhododendron, and all gods infernal, that if one single hair upon our heads is touched, Colonel Smith I shall see--Each newspaper in Boston and New-York shall be advertised with each and every property until it will bring ten thousand dollars per acre. We will settle you, any way--deal or no deal--Now sail in.

As this speech was heard by our guest the intensity of anger in his eyes vanished.
