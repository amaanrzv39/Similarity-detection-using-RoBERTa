Mad. de P.-- What would you sit upon, then?

Tullia.-- Well, I would definetely sit upon a couch.

Mad. de P. --Ay, I understand-- Maybe you should say a sofa; there is one. You can sit and recline if you like.

Tullia.-- I am glad to see that they have such comfortable furniture here in France. Just convenient as ours.
