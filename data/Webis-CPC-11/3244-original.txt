After a sitting of nearly seven hours on the second
day, when everything that could be lugged into connection with the silly affair had been said
and reiterated ten times over, the notary in attendance read over his condensed report of the
whole, and I was called upon for my defence. I told them plainly that I did not choose to make
any; that I was sick of the company of fools; that since it was a crime to speak the truth
in their good town, I was willing to pay the penalty for so doing, for the privilege of leaving
it; that I was astonished and disgusted at the spectacle of a company of grave men siding with
such a beggarly r√§uber (I believed that term was not proscribed in their precious statute)
as Karl Gurtler was, and taking advantage of the law, of which a stranger must necessarily
be ignorant, to obstruct him on his journey, and levy a contribution on his purse; and I added,
finally, for I had talked myself into an angry mood, that if the farce were not immediately
brought to a conclusion, I should despatch my friend forthwith to Berlin, and lay a report
of their proceedings before the British ambassador. I could perceive something like consternation
in the broad visage of the burgermeister as I concluded my harangue; but without attempting
to answer it, the Solons on the bench laid their heads together, and after a muttering of a
few minutes' duration, the schoolmaster pronounced the sentence of the court, which was, that
I should indemnify the plaintiff to the amount of one dollar, and pay the costs of the proceedings,
which amounted to three more.
