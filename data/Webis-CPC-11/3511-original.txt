For the soul, at the moment
of its separation from the body, enters upon a new life, whose course shall be exactly the
reverse of that of earth, for it shall constantly increase in all the attributes of youth.
There will be no dimming of the faculties, but a continual brightening; no grieving over an
irrecoverable past, but a constant rejoicing over joys present and to come. There will be no
past there, but a present more tangible than this, which is ever slipping from us, and a future
far brighter and more certain than any that earth can afford. Strange that men should fail
to look at heaven in this light! For thoughtless youth, to whom the world is new and bright,
and pleasure sparkles with a luring gleam, there is some little palliation for neglect of the
things of heaven; but what shall we say of him who has passed the golden bound, for whom all
giddy pleasures have lost their glow, and nought remains but the cares and anxieties of life?
Of what worth is earthly pleasure to him who has already drained its cup to the dregs? Of what
worth is wealth and honor to the frame that has already begun to descend the slope of time?
All these baubles would be gladly sacrificed for the return of that youth which has passed
away; and shall they not be given up for that eternal youth which shall not pass away? We mourn
for departed loved ones, but what would be our grief and despair if death were annihilation--if
we knew that we should never meet them again in all eternity?
