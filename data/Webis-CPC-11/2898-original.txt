As for prices, in these circumstances they would be affected or not, according as the improvements
in production did or did not extend to the precious metals. If the materials of money were
an exception to the general diminution of cost of production, the values of all other things
would fall in relation to moneyâ€”that is, there would be a fall of general prices throughout
the world. But if money, like other things, and in the same degree as other things, were obtained
in greater abundance and cheapness, prices would be no more affected than values would.

    As regards the precious metals, it is to be said that since 1850
    there has been a vast increase in their amount, and probably in
    greater proportion than the need arising from increased
    transactions.
