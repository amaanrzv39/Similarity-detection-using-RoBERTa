It is not accidental charm, but the eye in its continuous flow over the object is always the same answer, the adequacy thereof, and the very process of perception is pleasant in the ability of the object to be perceived. The parties, which are attached, form a single purpose, unity and simplicity of which are based on the pace and correspondence of its elements.

The symmetry here is what metaphysicians call a principle of individuation. For the emphasis on recurring items, cut the field in certain units, all that is between beats is an interval, an individual. If there were no recurrent impressions without corresponding points, the field of perception maintain a smooth continuity, without divisions defined and recognizable. The outlines of most things are symmetrical because we chose what we find lines of symmetry to the boundaries of objects. Its symmetry is the condition of its unity, and unity of their individuality and separate existence.

The experience certainly can teach us to respect asymmetric objects as a whole, because its elements move and change together in nature, but this is a principle of individuation, a posteriori, based on the association of recognized elements. These elements, to be recognized and seen to go together and form a thing has to be discriminated against in any way, and symmetry, either of its parts, or their position as a whole can afford to set their limits and to observe their number. The category of unity that we so often imposes on nature and its parts, has symmetry, then, for one of its instruments, one of its bases for the application.
