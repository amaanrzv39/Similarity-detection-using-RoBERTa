The duodenum, then, is a siphon trap, and a most efficient one. Now, the efficiency
of a siphon trap depends not only on its shape, but what is absolutely essential is that the
curve must be kept constantly full of fluid, without which it ceases to be a trap, and would
allow gases to ascend freely. The position of the place of entry of the ducts of the pancreas
and liver assures that this sine qua non shall be present. The discharge of the secretions
of the pancreas and liver, although more active during and after feeding, is practically constant,
and so insures in an admirable manner that the curve on which the efficiency of the trap depends
shall be constantly kept full not only with fluid, but, as I would suggest, antiseptic fluid.
There is no other trap in the intestinal canal, but the peculiar position of the colon would
no doubt have more or less effect in preventing gases ascending through the ileo-c√¶cal valve.--Lancet.

WISCONSIN CRANBERRY CULTURE.

Among the many thousands of well informed persons with whom the cranberry is a staple article
of food throughout the autumn and winter, and who especially derive from its pungent flavor
sharp relish for their Thanksgiving and Christmas turkey, not one in ten has any definite idea
as to where the delicious fruit comes from, or of the method of growing and harvesting it.
Most people are, however, aware that it is raised on little "truck patches" somewhere down
in New Jersey or about Cape Cod, and some have heard that it is gleaned from the swamps in
the Far West by Indians and shipped to market by white traders. But to the great majority its
real history is unknown.
