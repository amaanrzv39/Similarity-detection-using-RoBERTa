George
Washington was one of the first planters on the upper Potomac to change his money crop from
tobacco to wheat. He enlarged his mill and took advantage of the latest mechanical advances
of his time. However successful he became as a wheat farmer, he never escaped the trials and
grief caused by those middlemen, his agents. In 1767 he wrote a nine-page letter roundly berating
Carlyle and Adam for the destruction of his bags and for delay in paying him for his wheat.
