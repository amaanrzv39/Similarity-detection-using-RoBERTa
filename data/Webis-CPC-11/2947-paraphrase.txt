Prayers and faith may be a necessity in bringing  the children to the good shepard, who always remembered to tell his disciple to "Feed my lambs," and whose promise and prophecy before he descended into the world, was , "Out of the mouth of babies and sucklines I have ordained praise." The Bible tells us that it was God's purpose when he "set the solitary in families," to "seek a goodly seed."

How nice and comforting is the idea that in this sinful world of temptation, where there are three tough blocks to the final salvation of our children--the world, the flesh, and the devil, that angels or spirits that minister, are called to watch over the families of the just.
