Not content
with this, it was Churchill's influence, joined to that of his wife, which is said to have
induced James's own daughter, the Princess Anne, and Prince George of Denmark, to detach themselves
from the cause of the falling monarch; and drew from that unhappy sovereign the mournful exclamation,
"My God! my very children have forsaken me." In what does this conduct differ from that of
Labedoyere, who, at the head of the garrison of Grenoble, deserted to Napoleon when sent out
to oppose him?--or Lavalette, who employed his influence, as postmaster under Louis XVIII.,
to forward the Imperial conspiracy?--or Marshal Ney, who, after promising at the court of the
Tuileries to bring the ex-emperor back in an iron cage, no sooner reached the royal camp at
Melun, than he issued a proclamation calling on the troops to desert the Bourbons, and mount
the tricolor cockade? Nay, is not Churchill's conduct, in a moral point of view, worse than
that of Ney; for the latter abandoned the trust reposed in him by a new master, forced upon
an unwilling nation, to rejoin his old benefactor and companion in arms; but the former abandoned
the trust reposed in him by his old master and benefactor, to range himself under the banner
of a competitor for the throne, to whom he was bound neither by duty nor obligation. And yet
such is often the inequality of crimes and punishments in this world, that Churchill was raised
to the pinnacle of greatness by the very conduct which consigned Ney, with justice, so far
as his conduct is concerned, to an ignominious death.

  "Treason ne'er prospers; for when it does,
   None dare call it treason."
