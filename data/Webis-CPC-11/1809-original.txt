by Norman women, who repair here regularly once a-week from Granville to dispose of their fowls,
fish, eggs, fruit, and vegetables. Most of them were seated at their stalls, and industriously
plying their needles, when not occupied in serving customers. They had a mighty demure look,
and never condescended to solicit any person to deal with them--a mode of behaviour which the
butchers, fishmongers, fruiterers, and greengrocers, of Great Britain would do well to imitate.
