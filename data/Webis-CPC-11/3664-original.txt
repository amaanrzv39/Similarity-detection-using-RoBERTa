I will not dwell upon my adventures abroad: there is little to interest others in a recital
which awakens no interest in one's self.  I sought for wisdom, and I acquired but knowledge.
I thirsted for the truth, the tenderness of love, and I found but its fever and its falsehood.
Like the two Florimels of Spenser, I mistook, in my delirium, the delusive fabrication of the
senses for the divine reality of the heart; and I only awoke from my deceit when the phantom
I had worshipped melted into snow. Whatever I pursued partook of the energy, yet fitfulness
of my nature; mingling to-day in the tumults of the city, and to-morrow alone with my own heart
in the solitude of unpeopled nature; now revelling in the wildest excesses, and now tracing,
with a painful and unwearied search, the intricacies of science; alternately governing others,
and subdued by the tyranny which my own passions imposed--I passed through the ordeal unshrinking
yet unscathed.  "The education of life," says De Stael, "perfects the thinking mind, but depraves
the frivolous."  I do not inquire, Monkton, to which of these classes I belong; but I feel
too well, that though my mind has not been depraved, it has found no perfection but in misfortune;
and that whatever be the acquirements of later years, they have nothing which can compensate
for the losses of our youth.

FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.

I returned to England.  I entered again upon the theatre of its world; but I mixed now more
in its greater than its lesser pursuits.
