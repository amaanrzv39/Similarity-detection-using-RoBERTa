I, however, warned by the ways of critics, adopt different tactics. I start from the object-pole
of the idea-reality chain and follow it in the opposite direction from Schiller's. Anticipating
the results of the general truth-processes of mankind, I begin with the abstract notion of
an objective reality. I postulate it, and ask on my own account, I VOUCHING FOR THIS REALITY,
what would make any one else's idea of it true for me as well as for him. But I find no different
answer from that which Schiller gives.
