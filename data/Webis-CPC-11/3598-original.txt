Take these letters, and keep the direct road to Brasso,[9] by the Saxon-land.[10] You will
find free passage everywhere, and never look behind until the last pinnacles of the snowy mountains
are beyond your sight. Go! we will not take leave, not a word, let us forget each other!"

The Decurio watched the lovers until they were out of sight; and called to them, even when
they could hear him no longer: "Do not go towards Hungary."

He then entered his house. The prayer-book lay open as the young girl had left it; the page
was still damp with her tears. Numa's hand trembled, as he kissed the volume fervently and
placed it in his bosom.

When night came on, the Roumin lay down on his wolf-skin couch, where the golden-haired maiden,
and her lover before her, had slept, but it seemed as if they had stolen his rest--he could
not close his eyes there, so he rose and went out on the porch, where he spread his rug before
the open door; but it was long ere he could sleep--there was an unwonted feeling at his heart,
something like happiness, yet inexpressibly sad; and, buried in deep reverie, he lay with his
eyes fixed on the dark blue starry vault above him till past midnight. Suddenly he thought
he heard the report of some fire-arms at a great distance, and at the same moment two stars
sank beneath the horizon. Numa thought of the travelers, and a voice seemed to whisper, "They
are now happy!"

The moon had risen high in the heavens, when the Decurio was roused from his sleep by heavy
footsteps, and five or six Wallachians, among whom was Lupey, stood before him.

us their worth!" and taking two heads from his pouch he laid them on Numa's mat.
