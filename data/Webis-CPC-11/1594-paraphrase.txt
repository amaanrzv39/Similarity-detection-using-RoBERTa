Olsen levers use a Piston and a Diaphraigm to measure the work done to determine weight. There are multiple cylinders. The first cylinder is the largest with a 25 in radius, The smallest is less than a 3 inch radius. then there is a weighing beam that is ballanced upon them, which itself is a set weight and is not weighed but is used to help in measuring additional weights up to 1,000,000 lbs.
