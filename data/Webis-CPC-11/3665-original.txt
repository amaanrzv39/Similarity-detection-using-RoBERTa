All these characters are written in the Renaissance architecture
as plainly as if they were graven on it in words. For, observe, all other architectures have
something in them that common men can enjoy; some concession to the simplicities of humanity,
some daily bread for the hunger of the multitude. Quaint fancy, rich ornament, bright color,
something that shows a sympathy with men of ordinary minds and hearts; and this wrought out,
at least in the Gothic, with a rudeness showing that the workman did not mind exposing his
own ignorance if he could please others. But the Renaissance is exactly the contrary of all
this. It is rigid, cold, inhuman; incapable of glowing, of stooping, of conceding for an instant.
Whatever excellence it has is refined, high-trained, and deeply erudite; a kind which the architect
well knows no common mind can taste. He proclaims it to us aloud. "You cannot feel my work
unless you study Vitruvius. I will give you no gay color, no pleasant sculpture, nothing to
make you happy; for I am a learned man. All the pleasure you can have in anything I do is in
its proud breeding, its rigid formalism, its perfect finish, its cold tranquillity. I do not
work for the vulgar, only for the men of the academy and the court."

ยง XXXIX. And the instinct of the world felt this in a moment. In the new precision and accurate
law of the classical forms, they perceived something peculiarly adapted to the setting forth
of state in an appalling manner: Princes delighted in it, and courtiers. The Gothic was good
for God's worship, but this was good for man's worship. The Gothic had fellowship with all
hearts, and was universal, like nature: it could frame a temple for the prayer of nations,
or shrink into the poor man's winding stair.
