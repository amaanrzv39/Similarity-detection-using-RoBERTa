It is enriched with notes or mottoes in manuscript, and is even conjectured to be the actual
token by which Essex might have saved his forfeit life, if it had been delivered to the queen.
The title-page represents a triumphal arch, and has these words in black letter: "C. Certeine,

THE KING.

Authentic narrative of a plan, (now first made public,) for capturing Prince William Henry,
his present Majesty, during his stay at New York in 1782; with the original letters of General
Washington.

(From the Athen√¶um.)

It must be remembered that, wild as this project may seem, it was sanctioned by the cool deliberate
judgment of Washington; and it cannot, therefore, be doubted, that his Royal Highness was,
for a time, in a situation of great though unknown danger. We leave it to our readers to speculate
on the possible consequences, had the plan succeeded.

When his present Majesty William IV. served as a midshipman in the British navy, he was for
some time on the coast of the North American colonies, then in a state of revolution, and passed
the winter of 1782 in the city of New York. He is still borne in lively recollection by many
of the elder inhabitants of that city, as a fine bluff boy of sixteen: frank, cheery, and affable;
and there are anecdotes still told of his frolicsome pranks on shipboard.
