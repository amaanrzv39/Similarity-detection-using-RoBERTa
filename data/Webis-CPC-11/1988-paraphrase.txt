There has not been a Law-suit in the Parish since he arrived. If any quarrel arises they go to him for a decision. If they do not accept his judgment, which only happened once or twice at most, they appeal to me. At his first settling with me, I made him attend of all the sermons, and only pleaded that he would pronounce one of them in the Pulpit on Sunday.
