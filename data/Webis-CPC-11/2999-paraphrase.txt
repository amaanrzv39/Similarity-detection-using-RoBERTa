And this drove him to near madness.  He sad there, alone in front of his fire, imagining all these doubts locking them away in the deep synapses of his all to fragile mind.  The next day, he flung into action as he never had before.  He made it his mission to shut out that voice of hers, his  better half that he had intimately felt, into the virtual unknown. He figured, if he could just be so tired not to think of her, he would succeed at not causing such misery in his life.  Or at least that was the plan.  He often would dream of her letters, her beautiful voice, and most often...the hideous future without her.
