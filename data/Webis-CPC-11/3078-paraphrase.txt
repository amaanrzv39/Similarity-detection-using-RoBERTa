Mental institutions and prisons in urban and rural districts receive free book loans on a population basis. 

Books, magazines, and informative textbooks are available to rural people through the following processes:

(a) Books are loaned for free to libraries on a poulation basis, and these books are controlled by the local authorities. These authorities are bound under agreement to make their libraries free, and are charged with maintaining library service standars.

(b) Book loans to independent subscription public libraries for an annual fee, charged for every fifty books borrowed.

(c) 'Hamper collection' book loans to individual reader groups for a small annual fee.

(d) Free book loans to lighthouse keepers and other various remote readers.
