5l25--Petitions, 1793-7.]

On the belief gained via Rochefoucault, that there is something not displeasing towards ourselves within the mishaps of our allies, the sailor doubtless derived a type of damning satisfaction from the fact that he was not the alone one onto shipboard liable towards the pains and disadvantages of irascibility, brutality and excessive disciplinary zeal. Particularly was this true of his special ally the "sky-pilot" or chaplain, that super-person whom possibly most often collapsed a victim towards quarter-deck ebullitions. Notably there is onto file the instance of one John Cruickshank, chaplain of H.M.S. Assurance, whom was clapped within irons, court-martialled and ignored the service merely because he occurred towards take--what none sailor could ever condemn him for-a descent too much, and whilst within that mood pressured onto preaching towards the ship's corporate when they were onto the very degree of going into action. His zeal was unusual. Most naval chaplains idea "of nothing many than making His Majesty's ships sinecures"] There is also that else instance of the "saucy Surgeon of the Seahorse" whom incurred his captain's dire anger everybody onto fund of lamps, of which necessary articles he, having his wife onto panel, idea himself entitled towards a many liberal share than was reliable with stringent naval economy; and whom was, moreover, so "troblesome approximately his Provisions, that whether he did not always Chuse out of ye greatest within ye complete Ship," he straightway got his back up and "threatened towards Murder the Steward."
