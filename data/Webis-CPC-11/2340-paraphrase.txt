During this time, many publicly stated their distaste for slavery and their desire to see it ended. However, they failed to act on these sentiments time and time again. Laws passed during this era favored slave-holders over their abolitionist opponents.

The event considered by many historians to be the turning point leading the United States toward its Civil War and the eventual abolition of slavery was the murder of Rev. Elijah Lovejoy in 1837. He was shot while trying to safeguard the printing press he used to publish the Alton Observer, an abolitionist newspaper.
