That thought drove him
near insanity.  So he gathered up, alone before his fire, all these imaginings and doubts,
and sat with them into the night, and made a packet of them, and locked them away, as well
as he might, into a chamber of his memory.  And the next day he flung himself into his work
as he had not been able ever to do before; he made it his world, and resolutely shut out the
buoyant voice and the personality so intimately known, so unknown.  He tried to be so tired,
at night, that he could not think of her; and he succeeded far enough to make living a possibility,
which is all that any of us can do sometimes.  Often the thought of her, of her words, of her
letters, of the gay voice telling of a hideous future, stabbed him suddenly in the night, in
the crowded day.
