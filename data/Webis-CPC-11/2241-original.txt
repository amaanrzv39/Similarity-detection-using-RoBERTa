Was Charles II. ever in Wales?--There is a tradition amongst the inhabitants of Glamorganshire,
that, after his defeat at the battle of Worcester, Charles come to Wales and staid a night
at a place called Llancaiach Vawr, in the parish of Gelligaer. The place then belonged to a
Colonel Pritchard, an officer in the Parliamentary army; and the story relates that he made
himself known to his host, and threw himself upon his generosity for safety.
