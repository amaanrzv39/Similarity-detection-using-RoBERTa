After a few seasons permits for such operations were
discontinued, and the only foreign source of supply thereafter remaining open to the states

In 1870 it had become clear that to a continuation of efforts it was essential that a new supply

state of Maine, which, though very unproductive compared with Canadian rivers, might yet, perhaps,
be made to yield the requisite quantity of spawn.

A preliminary examination of the river brought out the following facts: The Penobscot is about
225 miles in length.
