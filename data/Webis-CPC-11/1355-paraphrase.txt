Around the year 1798 a “long” coach set came from Mr. Crosse’s, a place called the Crown Inn, then Portsmouth to Southampton, Salisbury, & Bristol, all of the Monday’s, Wednesday’s, and Friday afternoons. And before finishing with the White Hart Inn at Bristol, stops were made every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday at Gosport.

Note to whomever reviews this: I am sorry but this one was very hard. It seemed out of context and it was hard to try and determine what this was referring to. I did the best I could. Please don’t reject it. I will review them even more carefully before I review them next time.
