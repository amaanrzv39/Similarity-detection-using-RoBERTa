Goodfrey was known for being a generous man and one who was a great entertainer. Provisions were given for the the entire royal party when they were at the monastery; the king, queen, and all of their servants. When Prince Edward and Peter Gaveston arrived, they were given two beautiful coats. These were given by the abbot.

Many changes were made to the monestary to enhance its beauty. He built an enormous gate tower, which lead to teh Bishop's Palace. The room that was above this was the knights chamber.
On the wall, knights carrying their coat of arms were carved. 

Goodfry gave Edward Â£500 in total when he asked five times for money to help with his war against Scotland.
