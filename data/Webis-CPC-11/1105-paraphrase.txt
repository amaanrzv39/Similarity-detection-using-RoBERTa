When written history takes a side -- 
when it praises or blames in order to 
correct the perceived injustice in what 
actually happened (even though that's 
futile) -- it doesn't do what it's really 
supposed to. After all, the way things 
unfolded was according to God's undoubtedly
wise plan, however unknowable.
