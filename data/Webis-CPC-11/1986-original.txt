The King said to Little Margaret:

"Do you want to see us all go out to the Animal Farm?"

"Yes," said Little Margaret, "I will lead the way."

So she led the way along the street to the Animal Farm. Behind Margaret came the One-legged
King. Next came the Little Half Chick, next the Two-legged Cat, next the Three-legged Dog,
next the One-legged Crow, and last of all the Snake with no legs at all. So they all went out
to the Animal Farm. And there they lived happily ever after.
