The HOUSE FLY AND HOW TO SUPPRESS IT

The presence of flies is an indication of uncleanliness, insanitary conditions, and improper
disposal of substances in which they breed. They are not only annoying; they are actually dangerous
to health, because they may carry disease germs to exposed foods.

It is therefore important to know where and how they breed, and to apply such knowledge in
combating them. This bulletin gives information on this subject. Besides giving directions
for ridding the house of flies by the use of screens, fly papers, poisons, and flytraps, it
lays especial emphasis on the explanation of methods of eliminating breeding places and preventing
the breeding of flies.
