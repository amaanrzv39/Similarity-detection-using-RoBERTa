In 1893, the San Domingo Improvement
Company, an American corporation, under contract with the government took charge of the customs
collections for the purpose of providing for the services of the loans. The illegal imprisonment
of several Frenchmen gave rise to friction with the French government and in 1894 a French
fleet appeared before Santo Domingo City, but the matter was adjusted by the payment of an
indemnity. As the 1889 constitution forbade a president from holding office for more than two
terms in succession, Heureaux, wishing to continue in the presidency, obviated the difficulty
by the simple expedient of promulgating a new constitution in 1896, in which the limitation
was removed. He was declared unanimously elected in 1896 and began his final term on February
27, 1897.

The long period of comparative peace enjoyed by the country under the rule of President Ulises
Heureaux, or "Lilis," as the dictator was popularly known, brought seeming progress and prosperity,
though at a heavy price. Many of his opponents Heureaux was able to buy, and in this way he
retained the loyalty of hundreds of little military chiefs scattered through the country. Those
whom he could not buy he persecuted, imprisoned, exiled, or executed. While possessing pleasant
and affable manners, he was unrelenting in his persecution of conspirators and many stories
are told of his harshness in this respect.
