The shock, however, had been enough to
mar my power of enjoying Venice. We did, indeed, go about to see the usual sights; and even
the shadow-like attendance of the policeman ceased at length to give us much annoyance. But
I saw everything through an unpleasant medium, and heartily wished myself out of a region where
the government of pure force seems the only one attainable. At the end of a fortnight, we received
back our papers, with many apologies for their detention, and for the scrutiny to which we
had been exposed; which, however, it too truly appeared, had been brought upon us by that one
incautious expression of Claudia at Verona. Very soon after, we left Venice, and regained the
safe shores of England with little further adventure.
