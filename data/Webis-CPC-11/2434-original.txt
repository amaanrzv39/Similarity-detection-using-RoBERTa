GASPARD MONGE'S MAUSOLEUM.

(To the Editor of the Mirror.)

Sir,--As one of your correspondents has favoured you with a drawing of the gaol I designed
for the city and county of Norwich, with which you have embellished a recent number of the
MIRROR, I flatter myself that an engraving from the drawing I herewith send you of the mausoleum
of Gaspard Monge, which I drew while at Paris, in 1822, will also be interesting to the readers
of your valuable little miscellany.
