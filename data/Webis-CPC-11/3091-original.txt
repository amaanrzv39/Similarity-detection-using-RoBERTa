The "judicial" teacher, the man who from an Olympian elevation surveys the political strivings
of past and present alike, and analyses, catalogues, and defines, creating all the while an
impression of luminous impartiality, may, of course, do much good work.  The present writer
would be the last man to deny it when he remembers his own debt to a teacher of that kind.
None the less, we believe that it is the other kind of teaching that is really needed in the
schools of the well-to-do to-day.[2]  The political problems of our time are of intense and
terrible importance: on their solution this way or that depends the happiness or the misery
of uncounted millions; and it is so largely on the way that the young of the privileged classes
learn to look at them that their solution depends.
