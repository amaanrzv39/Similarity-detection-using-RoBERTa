When the indefatigable Cyrus told our people, five years ago, that he was going to lay a telegraph-cable
in the bed of the ocean between America and Europe, and place New York and London in instantaneous

like to see him do it!--a phrase intended to convey the idea that in their opinion he had promised
a great deal more than he could perform. But Cyrus was as good as his word.
