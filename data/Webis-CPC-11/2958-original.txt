The Bill had been drawn in exact conformity with the
Declaration. Who was to succeed if Mary, Anne, and William should all die without posterity,
was left in uncertainty. Yet the event for which no provision was made was far from improbable.
Indeed it really came to pass. William had never had a child. Anne had repeatedly been a mother,
but had no child living. It would not be very strange if, in a few months, disease, war, or
treason should remove all those who stood in the entail. In what state would the country then
be left? To whom would allegiance be due? The bill indeed contained a clause which excluded
Papists from the throne. But would such a clause supply the place of a clause designating the
successor by name?
