In addition to this, maps of
the spectra of some of the elements have been drawn up on a large scale, ready for publication,

Rowland's own observations, although, of course, most of them have been given by others:

Elements in the Sun, arranged according to Intensity and the Number of Lines in the Solar Spectrum.
