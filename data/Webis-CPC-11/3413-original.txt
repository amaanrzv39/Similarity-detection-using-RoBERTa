Portrait of Baretti (Vol. VIII., p. 411.).--In reply to MR. G. R. CORNER'S Query regarding
Sir Joshua Reynolds' picture of Baretti, I can give him the information he requires.

This very interesting portrait is now at my brother's, Holland House, Kensington.

My late father, Lord Holland, had a pretty picture of the late Lord Hertford's mother (I believe),
or some near relation of his. Not being connected with that family, my father offered it to
Lord Hertford, leaving it to his lordship to give him such picture as he might choose in exchange.
Some time afterwards this portrait of Baretti was sent, and was much prized and admired. It
represents Baretti reading a small book, which he holds close to his face with both hands;
he is in a white coat, and the whole carries with it a certainty of resemblance. This occurred
about twenty-five years ago. Perhaps it may interest your readers to learn that our distinguished
{478} painter, Watts, painted for my brother, Lord Holland, a portrait of another distinguished
Italian, Mr. Panizzi, and pendant to the former. He is represented leaning forward and writing,
and the likeness is very striking.

Passage in Sophocles.--In Vol. viii., p. 73., appears an article by MR. BUCKTON, in which he
quotes the following conclusion of a passage in Sophocles:

             "[Greek: Hotôi phrenas]
  [Greek: Theos agei pros atan;]
  [Greek: Prassein d' oligoston chronon ektos atas.]"

This, [Greek: petrôi stathmên harmozôn], he translates,--

    "Whose mind the God leads to destruction; but that he (the God)
    practises this a short time without destroying such an one."
