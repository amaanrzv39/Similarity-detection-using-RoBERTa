Arabs, the agriculturalists of the country, are for the most part from the original people in Sahara. They have preserved many practices, one of which being how they set up camp. The encampments are fixed at a far enough distance from the path of travelers that people would think the land uninhabited. In safer country sides they are set up in a straight line, but where there is fear of wild animals they are set up in a circular shape. Thorny bushes are placed around to prevent the arrival of any unwelcome visitors.
