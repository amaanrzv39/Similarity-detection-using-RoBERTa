Consider for example, a tenant in tail male died without issue male, after making a lease for years which covenants of right to let and for quiet enjoyment.  The plaintiff was assigned the lease by the lessee.  An action upon the covenant against the executer of the lessor, was brought, when the latter was soon turned out.  Since he was not privy in estate with the original covenantee, it was assumed that he could not recover.  The death of the lessor ended the lease, which was the original covenenteeâ€™s estate and before the form of assignment to the plaintiff, the estate tail out of which the lease was granted was terminated.  

To require assigns to be mentioned in order to enable them to sue, was the only point remaining to make the analogy between covenants for title and warranty complete.
