In less than a century, there are varieties of modern instruments such as telescope, microscopes, micrographs and telephones are in common use.  But at the same time, etheroscope is one of the modern devices which have been offered by the Royal Society. 

It is also necessary and important to know about the answer for a question.  The answer as per recent explanation is an English F.T.S., and the “Adepts” of the good law will reject gravity.  But some kind of misunderstanding is also there in impact theory.  But this is the only reasonable theory in the gravitation hypothesis.     According to their statement, for giving explanation on electric and magnetic distance- action, if the physicists try to make efforts to connect it with ether, they will have to face a complete failure in this regard.  This is also will occur importantly due to the race ignorance of the ultimate states of matter in nature and of the real nature of the solar stuff.
