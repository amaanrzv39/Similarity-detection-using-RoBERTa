"Funerals are a fairly sound
stunt, aren't they?"

"Funerals," observed the Adjutant, "are played out. If you come to me to-morrow and talk about
dead uncles and things I shall have all sorts of inquiries made that will surprise you. I've
been had before by funerals. When I was in the Army"--the Adjutant talks like this since he
was attached to the Flying Corps--"when I was in the Army there was a fellow who used to come
to the orderly-room and talk funerals to me until I was sick of the sight of him.
