Why, it would supply Henderson with jokes for six weeks," said Kenrick, getting up
and touching the old pony with his whip.  Both he and Walter were wholly unconscious that their
equipage had been seen, and contemptuously scrutinised by one of their schoolfellows.  Unknown
to Walter, Jones was in the train; and, after a long stare at the pony-chaise, had flung himself
back in his seat to indulge in a long guffaw, and in anticipating the malicious amusement he
should feel in retailing at Saint Winifred's the description of Kenrick's horse and carriage.
Petty malignity was a main feature of Jones's mind.

"That is Fuzby," said Kenrick laconically, pointing to a straggling village from which a few
lights were beginning to glimmer; "and I wish it were buried twenty thousand fathoms under
the sea."

Ungracious as the speech may seem, it cannot be wondered at.  A single muddy road runs through
Fuzby.  Except along this road--muddy and rutty in winter, dusty and rutty in summer--no walk
is to be had.  The fields are all more or less impassable with ditches and bogs.  Kenrick had
christened it "The Dreary Swamp."  Nothing in the shape of a view is to be found anywhere,
and barely a single flower will deign to grow.  The air is unhealthy with moisture, and the
only element to be had there in perfection is earth.

All this, Kenrick's father--who had been curate of the village--had fancied would be at least
endurable to any man upheld by a strong sense of duty.  So when he had married, and had received
the gift of a house in the village, he took thither his young and beautiful bride, intending
there to live and work until something better could be obtained.  He was right.
