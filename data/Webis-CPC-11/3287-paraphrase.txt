Motor expression is usually seen in self-pleasuring sexually significant, habitual movements. This is what psychophysics would call "physical stereotypy." Mentally, one would use obsessive thinking, physical actions, and thoughts as a defense mechanism against a guilty conscience. Tics occur when motor habits are partially inhibited. The tic itself is not usually sexual, because it is only a fragment of the original movement. Tics, in their final state, can either be conversion/hysteric or substitution/obsessive, or both.

Students of Freudism will understand this somewhat. Others may find this more difficult to understand if it is not explained further. I should say that, according to Freudians, tics are an obsessional/obsessive neurosis. The following quotation explains the Freudian theory of the evolution of and reason for these states. It is quoted from Clark's paper.

The painful idea's affect, rather than transforming itself into a physical symptom (which is what happens in hysteria) combines with more bearable ideas to create another obsession as a substitute.
