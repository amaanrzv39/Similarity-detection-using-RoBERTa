"chamber of presence," the nation's representatives invited the King to accept the crown; to
which the King replied: "I do esteem the affections of my good people more than the crown of
many Kingdoms, and shall be ready, by God's assistance, to bestow my life in their defence,
wishing to live no longer than I may see religion and this kingdom flourish in all happiness."
Thereafter, they proceeded to the "Kirk of Scoon, in order and rank, and according to their
quality."
