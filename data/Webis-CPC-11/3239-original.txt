Far better that our primitive emotions, with their vast store
of potential energy, should be won for spiritual interests on the only terms which they can
grasp, than that they should be left to spend themselves on lower objects.

If therefore the spiritual or the regenerate life is not likely to prosper without some incorporation
in institutions, some definite link with the past, it seems also likely to need for its full
working-out and propaganda the symbols and liturgy of a cultus. Here again, the right path
will be that of fulfilment, not of destruction; a deeper investigation of the full meaning
of cultus, the values it conserves and the needs it must meet, a clearer and humbler understanding
of our human limitations. We must also clearly realize as makers of the future, that as the
Church has its special dangers of conservatism, cosiness, intolerance, a checking of initiative,
the domestic tendency to enclose itself and shirk reality; so the cultus has also its special
dangers, of which the chief are perhaps formalism, magic, and spiritual sloth. Receiving and
conserving as it does all the successive deposits of racial experience, it is the very home
of magic: of the archaic tendency to attribute words and deeds, special power to a priestly
caste, and to make of itself the essential mediator between Creative Spirit and the soul. Further,
using perpetually as it does and must symbols of the most archaic sort, directly appealing
to the latent primitive in each of us, it offers us a perpetual temptation to fall back into
something below our best possible.
