After the required quantity of lime and carbonate of soda which is necessary for a total precipitation
has been figured out from the analysis of the water, respectively verified by practical experiments
in the laboratory, the heated water in the reservoir is mixed with the lime, in form of thin
milk of lime, and stirred up; we have to add so much lime, that slightly reddened litmus paper
gives, after 1/4 minute's contact with this mixture, an alkaline reaction, i.e., turns blue;
now the solution of carbonate of soda is added and again stirred well.

After twenty or thirty minutes (the hotter the water, the quicker the precipitation) the precipitate
has settled in large flocks at the bottom, and the clear water is drawn off into the pure water
reservoir.
