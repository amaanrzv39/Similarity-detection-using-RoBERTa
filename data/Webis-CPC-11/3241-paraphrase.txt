Therefore it is that I think it somewhat unfortunante the District Attorney should have thought it necessary to arrest councsel. If there be a person against whom no intimidation should be used, it is the counself for a poor, unprotected fugitive from captivity.--The question is, whether a man and his posterity forever, the fruit of his body, shall be slave or free. It is to decided on legal principles.  If there is a case in the world that calls for legal knowledge and ability--that calls for counsellors to come in and labor without or price, it is a case like this.  I think it a monstrous thing, unless it ba case beyond doubt, that counsel should have been selected to be proceeded against in this manner.

I take the facts to be these:--Mr. Davis, being a counsellor of this Court, and possessed of no small sympathy for persons in peril of their freedom, when it was known that a person claimed as a fugitive slave was arrested, and in a few hours, perhaps, to be send into eternal servitude, Mr. Davis steps over to my office and suggests to me that we offer our services as counsel.  He leaves his business, which is large, while five courts are in session in this building.  He sits here that whole Saturday forenoon by the prisoner, to whom he is recommended by Mr. Morton.  He is twice spoken of to Mr. Riley by the prisoner, as one of his councel.
