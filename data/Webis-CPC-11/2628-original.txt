The whole length of this temple is about 800 feet.

But the remains of Carnak, about one mile and a quarter lower down the river, are still more
wonderful than Luxor: one of the buildings is probably the temple of Ammon, which we know from
Diodoius was on this side of the river. An irregular avenue of sphinxes, considerably more
than a mile in length (about 6,560 feet), connected the northern entrance of the temple of
Luxor with it; but this was only one of several proud approaches to perhaps the largest assemblage
of buildings that ever was erected. For a minute description of Carnak we must refer to the
plans in the great French work, and to Dr. Richardson's and Mr. Hamilton's accounts.
