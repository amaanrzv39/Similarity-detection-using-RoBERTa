"Do you want everyone to visit the Animal Farm?' The King asked Margie.

"I do!" She exclaimed.  "Follow me!"

So, we all followed Margaret to the Animal Farm.  Directly behind her was the King with only one leg.  Following him was the half chick.  Following the chick was the cat on two legs.  Behind the cat came the dog with three legs, and behind the dog was the crow with only one leg.  At the end of the line was the snake, who slithered along on no legs.  We all lived happoly ever after, once we made it to the Animal Farm.
