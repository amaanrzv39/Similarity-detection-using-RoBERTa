It was this nobleman who erected the edifice which is now in ruins. Mr. Bray, in his Tour in
Derbyshire, observes: "This place was seized by the Parliament after the Duke went abroad,
and was sold and begun to be pulled down, but was then bought by Sir Charles, the Duke's youngest
brother, and so restored to the family."[2]

The present castle was built at different periods. The north-east end, which was erected by
Sir Charles Cavendish, about the year 1613, is the oldest.
