All old or new pastors, archbishops, bishops, cures, vicars, preachers, hospital and prison chaplains, superiors and directors of seminaries must follow a certain routine before they can minister to the general public.  This routine includes that they must state in writing that they are ready to take the oath and they must also take this oath in front of an audience.  Specifically, they must "in the presense of the general council, the commune, and the faithful" they "maintain with all they power" this oath of remaining faithful to their duties.  These duties to the Prebyterian Church are a prescribed oath that tells the public these men and women are ready to serve without reservations.
