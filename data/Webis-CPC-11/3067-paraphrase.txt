Some say that if Abraham Lincoln removed from the office of the President, and the Democrats once again ran the government, the Confederate Rebels would lay down their weapons and cease the succession from the United States, only if things were to return to the way they were before he was elected.  The rebellion was the result of the political shift that occurred in 1860, therefore if this shift was reversed and the former government reinstated, there would be no reason to rebel, and the succession movement would collapse. This mind set, one which justifies violence and bloodshed based on the outcome of an election would result in the country's downfall if allowed to persist.
