They had been strangers to each other when they started; but it was near
the end of the journey, and they were chatting pleasantly together now. One could see that
the little Old Lady was from the country; she was exquisitely neat and simple in appearance;
there was an air of primness about her which one rarely sees in a city product. She carried
a big bunch of hedgerow flowers. She seemed to be a little nervous about travelling, and still
more nervous about encountering the noise and confusion of the great city. She had asked the
Stockbroker and Curate a good many questions about the sights that she ought to see, and how
much she ought to pay the cabman, and which were the best shops.
