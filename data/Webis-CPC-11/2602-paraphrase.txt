(From the opposing arguments it must be that one of these shall follow)

1. In eclipses if is it not such a ruddy light that appears, then how can we not see the redness, when the more obsecure parts ot the Moon we may discern?

Perhaps you will reply that the closer you are to the greater light, the more the appearance is taken  away.

I respond that this is impossible, for why does Mars shine with its complete redness, when he is in fact closer to the Moon? or why is it that her powerful brightness does not make appear white as all other Planets? There also cannot be any given reason why a more powerful light should show her body under a color that is false.
