That villain, Slavata, owes me a life, he killed the son of my sister, and today, I will take it back, even at the price of my life. Don't be afraid Mandeville, I will protect you while I have my spear and armor.

I don't doubt it, Haggenhausen-- let us now charge together! It is not without my knowledge that you go to battle. The Blue Boar of Mandeville never fluttered as of yet in the Wallachian breeze, but wee may give it to the winds for too long. For Amalia, not me be the victory! Bring forward the Red Falcon of Kalbs-Kuchen, let it inspire fear into the enemy's hearts, and proceed as it dominates its prey.

The visors are down and lances are resting as we rush towards the hulans, who fought fearlessly.
