Suppose, for instance, that there has been an epoch of elevation, that mountain chains have
been lifted far into the sky and volcanoes have sent their floods of lava forth, and fault-scarped
cliffs run across the landscape and that then, for a while, the forces of elevation cease their
work. Little by little, the mountains will be worn down to a surface of less and less relief,
approaching a plain as a hyperbola approaches its asymptote--a surface which W. M. Davis has
called peneplain.
