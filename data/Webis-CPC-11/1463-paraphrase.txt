At the time your servant came, he sees that we had two small young lions, and through him we send the lions to you. Knowing we have receives through our servants given by your Master, three coach-horses. For each coach requires four horses to draw it. In order to obtain the coach with four horses, you need to send us another good one of the same kind and size. By all means you should oblige us since we depend on it. Farewell.
