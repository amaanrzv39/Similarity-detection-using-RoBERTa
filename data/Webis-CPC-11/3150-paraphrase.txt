And Tiny Bear squeaked out,

"Oh! here is a little young female in my bed; and it should be she who has consumed my morning serving of food and broken my chair."

Then Father Bear growled,

"LET US EAT HER UP;"

And Mother Bear growled, "LET US EAT HER UP;"

And Tiny Bear squeaked,

"LET US EAT HER UP."

The disturbance they made awakened Golden Hair, and you may envisage how scared she was when she glimpsed the three bears. She begun out of bed, and leapt at one time out of the window. The bears hurried after her, and Father Bear apprehended her golden hair in his teeth, but she left a secure behind, and still ran on. Then the three bears all leapt out after her, but they dropped one on the peak of the other and revolved over and over, and while they were picking themselves up, little Golden Hair ran dwelling, and they were not adept to apprehend her.
