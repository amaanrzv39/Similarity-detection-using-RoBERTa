(Is
he a Marinettist, I wonder?) There are not enough words in the language for him, so he invents
fresh ones at will; while as for grammar and syntax he passionately throttled them in Chapter
I.; nor did they recover. I will own that notwithstanding all this the author has a way of
making you read on to find out what it is all about. You don't find out; but there, life's
like that, isn't it? The author's ideas of the operations of high finance are ingenuous. The
Mandrill (do I rightly guess this to be a portrait distorted from the life?), who is out to
corner copper and "do down" the Squid (head of the opposing copper group), is, if you are to
judge by his passionate exuberance at board meetings, about as likely to corner the green cheese
in the moon.
