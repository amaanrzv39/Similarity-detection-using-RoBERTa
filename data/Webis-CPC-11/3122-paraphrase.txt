It is along such lines as these that our knowledge of the eugenic conditions of life will grow adequate and precise enough to form an effective guide to social conduct.  Nature, and a due attention to laws of heredity in life, will then rank in equal honour to our eyes with nature or that attention to the environmental conditions of life which we already regard as so important.  A regard to nurture has led us to spend the greastest care on the preservation not only of the fit but the unfit, while mean time it has wisely suggested to us the desirabily of segregating or even of sterilising the unfit.  But the study of Nature leads us further and, as Galton said,  "Eugenics rests on bringing no more individuals into the word than can be properly cared for, and these only of the best stocks."
