Falstaff's page told his master, that the Chief Justice is coming, who committed the prince for striking him about Bardolph. In the same scene Falstaff told Gascoigne, that the prince gave slap on his ears like a rude prince.And Gascoigne took that like a sensible lord.Also he told that he had checked the prince for that and the young lion repented for the same.
    Frequent allusion is made to it in the play.
