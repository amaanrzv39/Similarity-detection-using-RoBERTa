We have
an anecdote that shows how strong was the supremacy of paterfamilias at the beginning of the
eighth century, when Young Rome had already made more than one audacious display of contempt
for the Conscript Fathers. When Pompeius was asked what he would do, if Cæsar should resist
the requirements of the Senate, he answered,--"What if my son should raise his stick against
me?"--meaning to imply, that, in his opinion, resistance from Cæsar was something too absurd
to be thought of.
