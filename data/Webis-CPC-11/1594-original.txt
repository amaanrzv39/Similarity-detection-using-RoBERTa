The weighing device consists of a set of standard Olsen levers for weighing one-eightieth of
the total load on the main cylinder. This reduction is effected through the medium of a piston
and a diaphragm. The main cylinder has a diameter of 50 in., and the smaller one, a diameter
of 5-9/16 in. The weighing beam is balanced by an automatically-operated poise weight, and
is provided with a device for applying successive counterweights of 1,000,000 lb. each.
