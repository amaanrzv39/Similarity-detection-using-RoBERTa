As the maid withdrew Felice said to Guy that You need not kneel and weep like a girl. I want a brave knight as my groom.As a swan will never wed a swallow, I am interested to marry coward.  Show me that you are a brave young man before whose spear men bows like a king. I do not want any parentage to be proud off. I just want a self-made man. I only need my children to have their nobleness from the nobleness of a self-made man.A weeping  and delicate man is not in mydreams. A fighting, winning champion is my dream. At the same time I like the passionate lover  Guy the page.
