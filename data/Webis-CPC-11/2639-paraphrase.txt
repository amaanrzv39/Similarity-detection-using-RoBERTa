The rich of Frankfurt rarely dine after attending cultural events, but when they do, they typically eat at the restaurants of the finest hotels. Generally, Frankfurt is not open late.

On the Bockenheimerstrasse, one finds the Palmen Garten, a pleasant summer restaurant. Live music entertains you if you choose it sit at an al-fresco table. Alternately, you may enjoy the fine dining hall. The dishes are not terribly high class, but they are great examples of German cuisine. In the summer when it gets hot,  the restaurant is very pleasant. On holidays, diners may be entertained by fireworks. 

If you prefer something a little quieter, try Buerose. The hors d'oeuvres and the oysters are terrific.
