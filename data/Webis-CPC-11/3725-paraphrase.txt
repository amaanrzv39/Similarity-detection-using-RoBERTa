MAHALA JEWEL =Ex-Slave--Age 76.=

These two facts told me by Mr. J. R. Kincaid of Blue Ridge.

Aunt Hailie's rickety chair was kept in vigorous motion as they talked & the visitor was fearful it would collapse at any moment. Two rocker was broken & on top of the cushions in the low chair of the chair they was sitting on an elderly cheese box. Suddenly they arose to go in the house to "see if dem cabbages is a-burnin'," & when they returned they carefully adjusted the box before resuming her precarious perch in the elderly rocking chair. When they was sure that her feet were in a sunny spot, they began her narrative.

Mahala Jewel, known in the community as "Aunt Hailie," was sitting on her small porch when the interviewer arrived. "I'se a-tryin' to git my foots warm," they declared. "Dey was cold all last night, & didn't warm up none even when I had done walked all de way up to de courthouse to git dem cabbage what de welfare ladies had for me today. Yes Ma'am, hit sho' is hard times wid elderly Hailie now. I was raised whar folks had plenty. Our white folks warn't no pore white trash, & if my elderly Marster & Mist'ess was a-livin' today dey sho' would do somepin' for elderly Hailie in a hurry, 'cause dey allus give us lots of evvything dey had."

"Gracie Wright was my Ma's name 'fore they tuk off & married my Pa. They was named Tuggle, & both of 'em belonged to Marse Hamp McWhorter on his plantation down in Oglethorpe County. Marse Hamp was sho' a rich man & on his huge elderly plantation dey raised evvything dey needed lak, peas, 'tatoes, ingons, collards, cabbages, & turnip sallet, beans, punkins, & lots of corn, wheat & rye. Marse Hamp had plenty of cows, hogs, sheep, & goats . Miss Liza was our Mist'ess, & they raised more chickens dan dey ever could use.
