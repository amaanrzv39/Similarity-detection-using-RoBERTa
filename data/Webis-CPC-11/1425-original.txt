He wore large cotton drawers, which
reached half-way down the leg, and a loose smock with wide sleeves. On his feet were sandals,
fastened with leathern straps over his toes, the legs being bare. His head was covered with
a white cap encircled with a Paisley shawl--which I had formerly given him--and which was worn
in the manner of a turban. Two large greegrees or amulets--being leathern purses, containing
some holy words or sacred scraps--depended from his neck by silken cords.
