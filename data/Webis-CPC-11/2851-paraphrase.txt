My plan was this, I shot five, and hung them up, like thieves, to scare all that came to the corn; and from this time, as long as the dead ones hung there, not a bird came near. When the corn was ripe, I made a scythe out of the swords from the ship, and got in my crop.
Few of us think of the cost at which a loaf of bread is made. When I had got the corn home, I had to thrash it, part the grain from the chaff, and store it up. Then came the require of a mill to grind it, of sieves to neat it, and of yeast to make bread of it.

Still, my bread was made, though I had no tools; and no five could say that I did not earn it, by the sweat of my brow.

The next thing to be made was a sieve, to part the grain from the husks.
