For the soul, when the separation from the body enters a new life, whose course is exactly opposite to that of the earth, it must grow steadily in all the attributes of youth. There will be no diminution of faculties, but a continuous glow, not mourning over an irretrievable past, but a constant joy to come and present joys. There will not be passed, but more concrete than this gift that is always slipping from us, and a much brighter future and more secure than any earth can afford. Strange that men should fail to look at the sky in this light! Reckless youth, for whom the world is new and shiny, sparkles and fun, with a twinkle temptation, there are some little palliation for neglect of things in heaven, but what we say to him, which went gold bound for all intoxicating pleasures have lost their shine, and remains zero, but worries and anxieties of life? Why is the value of earthly pleasure it has already drained his cup to the dregs? Why is the value of property and honor of the framework has already started down the slope of time? All these baubles would be gladly sacrificed for the return of young people, who have passed and should not be given to that youth is eternal, which shall not pass? I left crying for their loved ones, but what should be our pain and despair that death was annihilation - if I knew that should never meet again for all eternity?
