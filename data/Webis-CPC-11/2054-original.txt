"Aged thirty years," again interrupted the Cure.  "Henri Rouget, idiot; as young as the morning.
For man grows old only by what he suffers, and what he forgives, and what he sins.  What have

"Do you know, Francois," he said, half sadly, "do you know, you have the true thing in you.
Come often to me, my son, and bring all these things --all you write."
