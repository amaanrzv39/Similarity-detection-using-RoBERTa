Maine was simply one of the
states which were cut off from the great duchy of France, and one over which Anjou, another
state cut off in the like sort, always asserted a superiority. Setting aside the great though
momentary incident of the war of the Commune, the history of Maine during its life as a separate
state consists almost wholly of its tossings to and fro between its northern and its southern
neighbours, Normandy and Anjou. The land of Maine, in short, is that of the district of a single
city, forming a single ecclesiastical diocese.
