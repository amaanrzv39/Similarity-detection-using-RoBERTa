My brother looked at the money he had paid him, and seeing that it was brilliantly white,
laid it aside by itself. The old man continued to pay him frequent visits for five months,
and my brother threw the money he received from him into a chest by itself. At the end of this
time, he thought to take out the money to buy sheep; so he opened the chest, but found in it
nothing but white paper, cut round. When he saw this, he buffeted his face and cried out, till
the folk came round him and he told them his story, at which they wondered. Then he rose, as
of his wont, and slaughtering a ram, hung it up within the shop; after which he cut off some
of the meat and hung it up outside, saying the while, "Would God that pestilent old man would
come!" And surely before long up came the old man, with his money in his hand; whereupon my
brother rose and caught hold of him, crying out, "Come to my help, O Muslims, and hear what
befell me with this scoundrel!" When the old man heard this, he said to him, "An thou loose
me not, I will expose thee before the folk!" "In what wilt thou expose me?" asked my brother,
and the other replied, "In that thou sellest man's flesh for mutton." "Thou liest, O accursed
one!" cried my brother: and the old man said, "He is the accursed one who has a man hanging
up in his shop." "If it be as thou sayest," rejoined my brother, "I give thee leave to take
my property and my life." Then said the old man, "Ho, people of the city! an ye would prove
the truth of my words, enter this man's shop." So they rushed into the shop, when they saw
the ram was become a dead man hanging up and seized on my brother, crying out, "O infidel!
O villain!" And his best friends fell to beating him and saying, "Dost thou give us man's flesh
to eat?"
