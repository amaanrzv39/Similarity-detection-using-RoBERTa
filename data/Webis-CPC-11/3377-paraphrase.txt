With brimming eyes they sorrowfully spoke of his deeds and beauty. Sacred word of prayer they spoke as the grieving mother and crying children were given to God to seek solace. This was the only source of strength in this time of sorrow and both prayers and thanks for the joys of the past and wishes for a better future were given. The hymn.
"Why should we grieve the dead or quiver at the thought of death?"

This part was read and sung aloud.

Here the children are again, all in their home where they had lived in the past, all except the son who has now passed on to a better place. But here they are now together in sorrow rather than joy. Times of happiness, times of sorrow, these are the human experience of life here on earth.

The tiny village grave yard was not too far away. There, a grave awaited for his arrival. Just a week ago he lived and was healthy, looking forward to a bright future and happiness to come. Yet now we are gathered in the grave yard in sorrow. 

"Ah, how would you have known, just that short while ago, this this bright youth would be picked by death from amongst them all?"

"Whose strong arm bent Defiance in the battle? Who cried the loudest as victory was won?"

"Who had the strongest most generous heart, no one better than he? Yet, it is him and not the others that we see lying here in death"
