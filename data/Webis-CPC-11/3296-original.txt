    "Printed for J. Roberts, near the Oxford Arms, in Warwick Lane,
    1716. 8vo."

The young man was Michael Aynsworth, of University College, Oxford, afterwards vicar of Cornhampton,
in Hampshire, and master of the Free School there. He was a native of Dorsetshire; his father,
who was in narrow circumstances, living near Wimborne St. Giles's, the seat of Lord Shaftesbury,
by whom the son seems to have been nobly patronised, on account of his inclination to learning
and virtuous disposition.

The published letters are only ten in number; but I have an accurate manuscript transcript
of fifteen, made from the originals by R. Flexman (who had been a pupil of Aynsworth) in 1768.
The transcriber's account is as follows:--

    "After Mr. Aynsworth's death, these letters remained in the
    possession of his daughter, and at her decease passed into the
    the hands of the Rev. Mr. Upton, the then vicar of Cornhampton;
    by him they were lent to my brother John Baker, of Grove Place,
    in Hampshire, who lent them to me. It will be perceived that the
    ten printed letters are not given as they were written, every
    thing of a private nature being omitted, and passages only given
    of other letters, just as the editor judged proper."

R. Flexman has made some remarks illustrative of the letters at the end of his transcript,
and added some particulars relating to Lord Shaftesbury.
