He then exhibits a specimen of that sly humour which characterized him to the last.

"A Quaker fellow-traveller stopped the coach at the inn at Tuxford to give the chambermaid
a sixpence, telling her that he had forgotten it when he slept there two years before. I was
a very saucy boy, and I said to him, 'Friend, have you seen the motto on the coach?' 'No.'
'Then look at it, for I think giving her only sixpence now is neither sat cito nor sat bene."

On his arrival in London, he was overturned, with his brother, in a sedan chair. "This," thought
he, "is more than sat cito, and it certainly is not sat bene." He concludes more gravely by
saying, "It was this impression which made me that deliberative judge, as some have said too
deliberative. And reflection upon all that is past, will not authorize me to deny, that while
I have been thinking, 'Sat cito, si sat bene,' I may not have sufficiently remembered whether
'Sat bene, si sat cito' has had its due influence."

The chief feature of this portion of the biography is its recollections of remarkable persons.
We have heard this one of Johnson before: but the names and place are now first given from
Lord Eldon's anecdote-book. He was at this period on the point of proceeding to India as judge.)
Sir Robert was gathering snails, and throwing them over the wall into his neighbour's garden.
The doctor attacked him roughly, and charged his conduct as being unneighbourly.
