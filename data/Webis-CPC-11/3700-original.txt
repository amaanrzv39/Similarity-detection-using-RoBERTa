To St. Petersburg he must go, the capital of talent, of aspiration, of hope, where are
published the magazines so eagerly devoured in the days gone by,--to the capital, where dwell
Zhukofsky and Pushkin. There his talents shall be recognized, and an appreciating world shall
receive the new-comer with open arms. The arms of the world do indeed open on his arrival at
St. Petersburg, but it is the cold embrace of want, of friendlessness. In St. Petersburg begins
for him a struggle for existence which well-nigh ruins him forever. Bread is not easily earned.
Congenial society does not readily seek him out, and the sympathetic appreciation his starving
soul craves is still as far as ever. Inevitable disappointment of hero-worship also quickly
comes. When he calls at the door of the idolized Pushkin late in the morrow, he is told by
the valet that the great man is deigning to be asleep at this late hour. "Ah, your master has
been composing some heavenly song all night!" "Not at all; he has been playing cards till seven
in the morning!" And to complete his doom, his tender susceptible heart begins to flutter with
right serious ado at the sight of a dame of high social position who hardly deigns to cast
even a glance at the moneyless, ill-clad, clumsy, rustic lad,--sorrows enough for a soul far
better equipped for battle with Fortune than this poor Cossak lad. Total ruin is now dangerously
nigh. And here Gogol becomes high-handed. He must be off, away from this suffocation of disappointment
and despair.
