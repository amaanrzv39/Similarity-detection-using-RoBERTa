Such designs are found in every zone
among nations the farthest removed from each other, either with respect to their respective
positions on the globe, or to the degree of civilization which they have attained. They still
adorn the common pottery made by the inhabitants of the little mission of Maypures; they ornament
the bucklers of the Otaheitans, the fishing-implements of the Esquimaux, the walls of the Mexican
palace of Mitla, and the vases of ancient Greece.
