Some say that he sent off sentence of suspension and excommunication; others, that he owned
the justice of Grosteste's letter. It made little difference to the good Bishop, who lay on
his deathbed long before the answer arrived. He spoke much of the troubles and bondage of the
Church, which he feared would never be ended but by the edge of a blood-stained sword, and
grieved over the falsehood, perfidy, and extortion, that were soiling his beloved Church; and
thus he expired, uplifting his honest testimony both in word and deed, untouched by the crimes
of his age.

Innocent IV. did not long survive him, and there is a remarkable story of the commencement
of his last illness. He dreamt that the spirit of Robert Grosteste had appeared, and given
him a severe beating. The delusion hung about him, and he finally died in the belief that he
was killed by the blows of the English Bishop.

Sewel, Archbishop of York, had the same contest with Rome. Three Italians walked into York
cathedral, asked which was the Dean's seat, and installed one of their number there; and when
the Archbishop refused to permit his appointment, an interdict was laid on his see, and he
died under excommunication, bearing it meekly and patiently, and his flock following his funeral
in weeping multitudes, though it was apparently unblest by the Church.

These good men had fallen on days of evil shepherds, and lamentable was the state of Europe,
when men's religious feelings were perverted to be engines for exalting the temporal power
of the popedom, and their ministers, mistaking their true calling, were struggling for an absolute
and open dominion, for which purity, truth, meekness, and every attribute of charity were sacrificed.
