It appeared in Wordsworth's poems of 1815
with the following title:--"Influence of Natural Objects in calling forth and strengthening
the Imagination in Boyhood and Early Youth."

The opening verses of this poem are still another instance of the identification of God with
nature.  As Mr. Stopford Brooke writes, "we are here in contact with a Person, not with a thought.
But who is this person?  Is she only the creation of imagination, having no substantive reality
beyond the mind of Wordsworth?
