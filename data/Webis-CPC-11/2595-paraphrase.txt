To follow the property throughout all of its possessors is not needed. During the Henry VIII reign Thomas Howard owned the property, being the first Duke of Norfolk. The castle was reverted back to the crown due to the attainder of his son. Not long after this event, it was given to Sir John Byron for a total of fifty years. Earl of Shrewsbury, Gilbert Talbot, owned Bolsover, during the reign of James I. In 1613 Gilbert Talbot sold the property to Sir Charles Cavendish, whose son William being the oldest, was the first Duke of Newcastle, a person of very high status among the nobles of this time, and held in very high regard at court. He was devotedly close to his royal master, Charles I, whom he provided entertainment for at Bolsover Castle, in a manner of royal greatness, on three occasions.
