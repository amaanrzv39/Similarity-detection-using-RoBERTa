Poor Arthur! he no longer had a smile or caress even for Rover, the companion
of his lonely hours, the sharer of his exile! He did not even notice him, except by raising
his hand to keep him off.

After three weeks of severe suffering, a change came over the beloved child. The physician
thought it barely possible that such a crisis might terminate favorably, and had prescribed
powerful stimulants, but it was soon evident that he was rapidly sinking in spite of them.
He suffered no longer, but the shadows of the grave were gathering upon his face, and it was
not probable he would survive till morning. But Mrs. Hamilton did not wish any one to sit up
by his bedside except herself.
