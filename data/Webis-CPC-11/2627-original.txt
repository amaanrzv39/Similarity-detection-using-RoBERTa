B.C. 389-388. (1) On the expiration of winter, and in fulfilment of his promise to the Achaeans,
Agesilaus called out the ban once more with early spring to invade the Acarnanians. The latter
were apprised of his intention, and, being persuaded that owing to the midland situation of
their cities they would just as truly be blockaded by an enemy who chose to destroy their corn
as they would be if besieged with entrenchments in regular form, they sent ambassadors to Lacedaemon,
and made peace with the Achaeans and alliance with the Lacedaemonians. Thus closes this page
of history concerning the affairs of Arcarnania.

 (1) According to others, B.C. 390.
