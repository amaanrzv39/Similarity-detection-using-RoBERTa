The Prince, wearing his ducal cap and dress, reposes
on a couch, the cushion supporting his head being covered with delicate sculptures, his feet
resting on a lion recumbent, his hands clasped, his face slightly turned towards Margaret of
Austria, his wife. On each side, little lovely naked boys, geniuses, loves, cherubs--call them
what we will--support his helmet and gloves, and charming statuettes after the same dainty
pattern stand at each corner of the sarcophagus supporting his shield and various pieces of
armour. Underneath, on a slab of black marble, lies the figure of the dead Prince, the finely
modelled limbs only partially draped, the long hair curling round the bare shoulder, the beautiful
face turned, as in the first instance, towards the image of his wife--pose, expression, design,
all combining to make up an exquisite whole. This second figure is a master-piece, and no less
masterly are the Sibyls and other figures which surround it, each statuette deserving the most
careful study, each, in fact, a little gem. The frame-work of this noble monument is of rich
Gothic design, too elaborate, perhaps, to please the fastidious critic, but deliciously imaginative,
and finished as far as artistic finish can go. To the right of the Prince is the tomb of Marguerite
of Burgundy, his mother, a hardly less sumptuous piece of work than the first, and superbly
framed in by Gothic decorative sculptures, statuettes, arabesques, flowers, and heraldic designs.
