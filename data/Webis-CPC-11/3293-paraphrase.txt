We shoud no be incorrect in dating them 1493.5. Carpaccio's influence is known, as we have noticed, and through this channel Girogione's art connects with the more antiquated style of Gentile Bellini, Giovanni's elder brother. He is united the quattrocentist tradition and the newer ideals of cinquecento, which found its earliest expression in Giambellini's Allegories around 1486-90. The sincerely poetic style in this work strongly appealed to Giorgione's ultra sensitive nature, and we have found him developing this version of his art in the Beaumont "Adoration," and the National Gallery "Epiphany," both of which are his first pieces. But there is a big difference in years between the Uffizi pictures and the London ones, for the latter are much more mordern in every way, and it is well known that the time in between must have been spent in constant training. 
Yet we cannot be sure that any of the other pictures in our list as standing partway in development, and here it is that a coffer exists in the artist's career. 2 or 3 years, possibly more, remaincompletely unknown, just at a period, too, when the young artist would be most impressionable. I believe that he may have painted the "Birth of Paris" during these years, but we only have a small piece of the original composition to go by, and the words of the Anonimo that the picture was one of Giorgione's earliest pieces.
