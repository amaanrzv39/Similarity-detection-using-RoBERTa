The Priest may not finish the remaining bread at this time.

After this portion of the service is concluded, the Priest shall place the cover on the chalice containing the remaining wine.  The paten, a plate containing the bread, shall not be used as a cover, but is placed in front of the chalice.  Finally, a fine linen cloth is then draped to completely cover both.  The linen must not be silk, cotton, or any other fabric.

Then the Priest recites the Lord's Prayer with the people repeating each line after him.

Then the Priest says, Oh Lord and the others...

Or Almighty and the others...
