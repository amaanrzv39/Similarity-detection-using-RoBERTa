The expression of a gentlemen regarding a public will is not known..Two candidates were presented to the House of Representatives with equal suffrages.. The constitution gave us the right and duty to elect any  one of the two whom we thought preferable. A public man is to notice the public will as constitutionally expressed.Men from Virginia, and many others, may have their  preference; but that preference of the public will not appear by its constitutional expression.
