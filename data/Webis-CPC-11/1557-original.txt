Why run any chance of losing
on a race, but simply "ask Planchette?" Only, by the way, if this were universal, and if everyone
is to win, who is to lose? Thus Planchette would put an end to nearly all speculation. Planchette
would inaugurate a new era of complete and unqualified success. No doubt Mr. CHARLES WYNDHAM
consulted Planchette before producing The Fringe of Society, and is in consequence being amply
rewarded for placing his trust in Planchette.
