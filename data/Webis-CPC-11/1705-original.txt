His judgment of horseflesh
is no better than his luck at cards. He came a cropper over the "Two Thousand Guineas." The
victory of the favorite cost him to the tune of over six thousand pounds. We learn that he
hopes to recoup himself on the Derby, by backing Shylock for nearly nine thousand pounds; one
bet was twelve hundred guineas.

And this is the sort of man who may be chosen at any time by force of family interest to make
laws for the toiling millions of Great Britain!
