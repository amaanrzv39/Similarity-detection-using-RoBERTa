The objective was to plant them in New England: they'd grow there, but they definitely wouldn't stay. Soon after I took over the department, I received a rather eloquent letter from a Western state, wanting a Consulate. They stated, quite clearly, that their only desire was to live somewhere other than New England. This desire, it seems, has been near-ubiquitous among New Englanders ever since they came to these shores. But, trust me, if you're planted in the South, with its welcoming climate and abundance of good soil, that desire to love somewhere else would never exist.
