I rise, gentlemen to declare my feelings on this most solemn and serious subject. This imposed a burden on my mind, which, I fear, nothing can eliminate, but push me to strive to reduce it, through a free and unreserved communication of my feelings.

In the first part of the address, I am heartily concurring with the noble Earl who moved. No man feels joy sincerer than me, nobody can offer more genuine congratulations on every accession to power of the Protestant succession. I join, therefore, each card on the birth of another princess, and happy recovery of HM.

But I must stop here. My courtly complaisance will carry me no farther. I will not take part in greeting the misery and disgrace. I can not agree to a blind and servile address, which approves and endeavors to sanctify the monstrous measures which have heaped disgrace and misfortune upon us. This, gentlemen, is a dangerous time and extraordinary! This is not a time for adulation. Smooth flattery can not now benefit - can save us in this rugged and awful crisis. It is now necessary to instruct in English throne truth. We must dispel the illusion and the darkness which envelops them, and display in its full danger and true colors, which brought ruin to our doors.

This, gentlemen, is our duty. Is the corresponding function of this noble assembly, sitting as we do in our honor in this room, the council inherited the crown. Who is the minister - where is the minister who dared to suggest the English throne contrary, unconstitutional this day delivered from it? Parlance of the throne was Parliament's request for advice, and a reliance on its constitutional advice and assistance.
