Since I met with these lines however, I have found that Napoleon had in his youth
composed a poem on Corsica, some extracts of which are to be found in "Les Annales de l'Europe"
a German collection. He was exceedingly anxious in after life to destroy the copies of this
poem which had been circulated, and bought and procured them by every means in his power for
the purpose of destroying them; it is probable not a single copy is in existence at the present
period.
