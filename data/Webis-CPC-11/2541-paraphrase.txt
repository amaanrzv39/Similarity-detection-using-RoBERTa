Dr. Robert Carothers, of Neport, performed a post-mortem examination of the body at 3:00 on Monday afternoon at White's mortuary.  Witnesses included Dr. J.O. Jenkins, Drs. J.L and C.T.Phythian, Dr. J. W. Fishback and Cornoner W.S. Tingley.  The autopsy was quite thorough and lasted more than an hour.  The post-mortem revealed a fetus of between four and five months' gestation, which was determined to be the woman's first pregnancy.  The woman was found to be less than 20 years of age at the time of death.  The fetus was removed from the body and taken to A.F. Goetze's pharmacy, located on the corner of 5th and York Streets, where it was preserved in alcohol.
