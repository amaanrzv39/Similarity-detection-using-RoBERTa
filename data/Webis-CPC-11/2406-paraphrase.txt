It seems hard to understand how such a useful support to the surgeon as the ligature could possibly be permitted to go out of use and be forgotten. It will not be difficult, for anyone who recalls the conditions of old-time surgery. The ligature is an immediate resource in stopping the bleeding of an artery. But a septic ligature unavoidably causes infection and almost inescapably leads to a second hemorrhage.
