We had all agreed that as soon as the dinner-bell rang, we would all start off together and make our for the apple orchard at the top of the hill. We were unlikely to be disturbed here. 

I remember this day quite well and how hot that July  afternoon had been. We lay amongst the long grass looking up at the young apples above us. Every now and then we would set our teeth in the sour middles of those apples that had fallen. We did no more than taste these unripe apples because we were a afraid of the possible affects they might have on us if we ate them.
