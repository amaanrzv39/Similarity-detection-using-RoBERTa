Supporting the opinion I expressed previously, Captain Wickham did not remark any above the entrance of the river. Mr. Clark shared the unique fact that a water-worn piece was found on a mountain over 25 miles inland from Clarence River. The origin of this piece is unknown. It is possible that it was carried by a native or floated there during a time of higher sea levels. 
It was extremely difficult to reach the highest point of the cape, which is over 2,000 feet high.
