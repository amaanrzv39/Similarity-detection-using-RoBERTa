Amable turned from her father's disapproving gaze with a light laugh, and light of step, stealthily skipped round the garden wall and bounded towards the grove of wild shrubs at the far end.

The sun bathed the tree with its light, and the air hummed with the sweet sound of birdsong.  Heaven's face was undimmed by a single spot of shade, and green earth sparked with beauty beneath it.  Such was the scene, but Amable's mind  was caught with a warmer and even brighter sun, shining upon her maiden dreams, while the sweet rich voice of Hope in her heart drowned the melody of the woods.
