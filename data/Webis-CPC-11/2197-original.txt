These minute details will be my only answer to some culpable expressions that I have met with
in a work very widely spread: "M. Laplace," says the anonymous writer "knew all the secrets
of geometry; but he had not the least notion of the state France was in, he therefore imprudently
advised Bailly to go and join him."

What is to be here deplored as regards imprudence, is, that a writer, without exactly knowing
the facts, should authoritatively pronounce such severe sentences against one of the most illustrious
ornaments of our country.
