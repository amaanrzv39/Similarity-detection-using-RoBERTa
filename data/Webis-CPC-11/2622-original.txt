In order to facilitate the manufacture of like
tissues on the power loom the celebrated Swiss manufacturer, Hanneger, has invented an apparatus
in which the shuttle is not thrown, but passed from one side to the other by means of hooks,
by a process analogous to weaving silk by hand. A loom built on this principle was shown at
work weaving silk at the Paris Exhibition of 1878. This apparatus, represented in the annexed
figure, contains some arrangements which are new and interesting. On each side of the woof
in the heddle there is a carrier, B. These carriers are provided with hooks, A A', having appendages,
a a', which are fitted in the shuttle, O. The latter is of peculiar construction.
