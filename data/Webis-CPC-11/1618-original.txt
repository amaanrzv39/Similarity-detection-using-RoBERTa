It is not, generally
speaking, natural that a being like Emilia should ever inspire love.

The Mort de Cesar is a mutilated tragedy: it ends with the speech of Antony over the dead body
of Caesar, borrowed from Shakspeare; that is to say, it has no conclusion. And what a patched
and bungling thing is it in all its parts! How coarse-spun and hurried is the conspiracy! How
stupid Caesar must have been, to allow the conspirators to brave him before his face without
suspecting their design!
