Thus the good fall and
the Thersites live, and are often even honoured. Captain Campbell was one of our benefactors,
may his manes be sensible to our regret, and may his family and country permit us to mingle
with their just affliction, this weak tribute of respect, by which we endeavour as far as lies
in our power to discharge the sacred debt of gratitude!

Among the losses which this expedition has experienced, it is feared that we must reckon that
of our excellent companion, the Naturalist Kummer; nevertheless, as no positive information
of his death has yet been received of his fate, his numerous friends, in the midst of their
fears, still cherish some hopes: May they not be disappointed.
