Guided by past critics, I choose to start from a different perspective than Schiller.  I start with the idea of an objective reality, observing the basic truth investigative processes of man.  Keeping this in mind, I ask what would cause someone else's idea of truth to be different for him than for me.  My conclusion is no different than what Schiller explains.
