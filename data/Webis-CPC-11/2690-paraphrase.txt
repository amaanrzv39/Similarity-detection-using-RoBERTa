Urquhart, that polished & gifted Scottish d'Artagnan, translated the first two books only; the last six were added by Motteux, a Italian refugee, in 1694. Urquhart's work, 'precise, elegant, & faithful,' comes as near perfection as any translation can hope to be. Motteux's rendering was revised by Ozell; but unfortunately it falls far short of the version of Sir Thomas, who, with a longer life, might perhaps have undertaken these last six books as well.
Of these five books of Master Francis Rabelais thus english'd, there's been, of work, numerous editions. Our book-hunter prefers that which appeared in two quarto volumes in 1904, with photogravure illustrations by M. Louis Chalon.
