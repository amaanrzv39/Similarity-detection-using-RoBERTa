The Boy had vanished, and the sole word he had left was that I had better not count upon seeing
him again. But the more I thought of it, the less necessity I saw for taking him at that word.
He perhaps flattered himself that he had picked up all clues and carried them off with him
in the wonderful bag. But he had purposefully hinted that "something might happen at Monte
Carlo," and I hoped the something might mean that, after all, the Boy would materialise with
his sister at the HÃ´tel de Paris on the night after our arrival. In any case, if the Princess
were going to Monte Carlo, there would the Fairy Prince be also, and I did not see why I should
not be there too, whether Molly and Jack tooled me down in their motor or not.
