The man himself may repent; may make to himself a new heart and a new spirit. This
is his way out. If a man gets into unbelief through a misunderstanding of Bible facts he will
never get out short of a better understanding of those same facts.

If he gets in through the impression that science and the Bible are in conflict, there is no
way to get him out short of a removal of the impression. Hence the importance of ministers
being scientists. Many unbelievers claim that the Bible and science conflict, who have never
investigated them, and know comparatively nothing of either. This class, too, is in the majority.
They are men who ape certain leaders, being under their influence. Many of them love to have
us know that they know something about such men as Strauss, notwithstanding their ignorance
of even the man. To have such a mind do their thinking is the highest of their ambition. There
is a good deal of heart disease about these fellows. They really glory in the names of such
men as Strauss. He was so far away that they never learned the fact that "he was divorced from
his wife, the former actress, Agnese Schebest, and spent his days going about from place to
place. His pseudo-theology or mythology ended in a theatrical comedy, and the comedy in a tragedy."
"In 1839 this famous Dr. Strauss--who resolved the gospel history of salvation into an incoherent
and self-contradictory mythological poem, and denied the existence of a personal God and the
immortality of the soul--was duly elected professor of Christian dogmatics and ethics in the
University of Zurich, by the party then in power, which consisted mostly of demagogues and
frivolous infidels."
