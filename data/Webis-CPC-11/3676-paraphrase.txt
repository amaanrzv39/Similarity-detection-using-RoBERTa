daughters Angel's (pleasanter angels Mr. Idle and Mr. Goodchild never saw, nor more peaceful expert in their businesses, no more upper Vice common to be above it), have a little time to rest, and air cheerful faces of their among the flowers in the yard. Is market day. The market seems unusual natural, comfortable, and healthy people market. The town seems quite restored, when, come on! a metal Bray - Gong-donkey!

Wretched animal has not cleared off the rest, but here, under the window. How much more inconceivably drunk now, with as much begrimed by foot, how much closer calico hide, the more turns and daubed and dirty and dunghilly from his horrible broom on toes its bid, which is saying! He can not even shake Bray himself out now, without laying his cheek so close to the mud of the street, that he pitches over after its delivery. Now, prone in the mud, and now supports himself against the windows, owners coming in terror to remove him now, the drinking-shop, and now in tobacco, where it is going to buy tobacco, and make your way to beauty and if he gets a cigar, which, in half a minute, he forgets to smoke, now dancing, now dozing, now cursing, praising, and now my Lord, Colonel, Captain Noble, and worship your honor, Gong kicks ass at his heels, occasionally braying, until suddenly, he sees them dear friend in the world coming down the street.
