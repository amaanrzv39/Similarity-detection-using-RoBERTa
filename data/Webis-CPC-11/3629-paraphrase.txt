Our time came to be indignant when applying the Christian sermon "paradoxes" of industry, trade and international relations.

It is in this sense that religious education can be absorbingly interesting. Everything comes to and from the old question: "We will apply Christianity to the problems of modern society or not?"

The direction of education to date most of the religious has been too purely personal, the call is too obvious and the appeal is deflated. Politics without religion is unfounded, but religion without politics is not even half of its contents. Christianity is the yeast, but also what is the policy of mass.

In this regard, we believe, could be obtained at the middle and lower school results similar to those described in the cases of some children in sixth grade. The author of this book used to teach theology to an intermediate form in the modern side, and every time he became a gospel set, were found large quantities of material at hand. It is surprising how little, for all the sermons they have heard, most boys of sixteen years have confronted the ideas expressed in the texts beaten. "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle ...." "Love your enemies." "Do not worry about tomorrow." A more cross-truth is about these words should not be taken literally. The children have told me that a "rich man" means one who is enriched by robbery. Well, what is theft? "Property, c'est vol him? "Love your enemies" means, I am told, "Do not be enemies to lead a peaceful life, but if ..."
