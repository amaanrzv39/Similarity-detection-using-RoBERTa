Whether it was modesty, indolence, indifference, or incompetence,
some drawback or shortcoming there was which so far impaired the quality of his strong and
delicate genius that it is impossible for his most ardent and cordial admirer to say or think
of his very best work that it really does him justice--that it adequately represents the fulness
of his unquestionable powers. And yet it is certain that Lamb was not less right than usual
when he said that Dekker "had poetry enough for anything." But he had not constructive power
enough for the trade of a playwright--the trade in which he spent so many weary years of ill-requited
labor. This comedy in which we first find him associated with Middleton is well written and
well contrived, and fairly diverting--especially to an idle or an uncritical reader: though
even such an one may suspect that the heroine here represented as a virginal virago must have
been in fact rather like Dr. Johnson's fair friend Bet Flint; of whom the Great Lexicographer
"used to say that she was generally slut and drunkard; occasionally whore and thief" (Boswell,
May 8, 1781). The parallel would have been more nearly complete if Moll Cutpurse "had written
her own Life in verse," and brought it to Selden or Bishop Hall with a request that he would
furnish her with a preface to it.

The plays of Middleton are not so properly divisible into tragic and comic as into realistic
and romantic--into plays of which the mainspring is essentially prosaic or photographic, and
plays of which the mainspring is principally fanciful or poetical. Two only of the former class
remain to be mentioned: "Anything for a Quiet Life" and "A Chaste Maid in Cheapside."
