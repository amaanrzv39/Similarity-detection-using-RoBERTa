M. Flaubert has taken the outlook of the greatest unction from a journal which a venerable ecclesiastic, one of his acquaintances, let to him; this matching acquaintance has read the outlook and been moved to tears, not supposing that the majesty of faith was in any way offended. The journal is entitled: An historic, dogmatic, significance, liturgical and canonical elucidation of the catechism, with an reply to the objections drawn from research against faith, by the Abbé Ambroise Guillois, curate of Nôtre-Dame-du-Pré, 6th publication, etc., a work commended by His Eminence the Cardinal Gousset, N.N.S.S. the Bishops and Archbishops of Mans, of Tours, of Bordeaux, of Cologne, etc., vol. III., issued at Mans, by Charles Monnoyer, 1851.
