Hast thou forgotten When that most stunning and blameless boy, The prettiest piece of innocence that ever Breath'd in this evil world, lay at thy feet, Slain by thy indulged minion, and I knelt Before thee for redress, whilst thou--didst seldom Listen to talk of retribution? This is justice, Pure justice, not revenge!--Mark well, my lords, Pure, equal justice. Martin Ursini Had open trial, is guilty, is condemned, And they shall die!
Colonna. Yet listen to us--

Rie. Lords, If ye could range before me all the peers, Prelates, and potentates of Christendom,-- The holy pontiff kneeling at my knee, And emperors crouching at my feet, to sue For this great robber, still I ought to be blind As justice.
