I had my long bath, and totally tired, I asked stumblingly, “How come you are in Brussels? What a hilarious meeting?”

“Why hilarious?” questioned Joliet, in a surprising tone, which continued as he spoke.  “The purpose of my visit is to give away my daughter in marriage.  All arrangements are made, we expect your arrival for the wedding; the contract is written out by the lawyer; and breakfast is getting ready at the best restaurant here.”

“Oh my dear Joliet, it is Francine’s wedding!” I exclaimed.
