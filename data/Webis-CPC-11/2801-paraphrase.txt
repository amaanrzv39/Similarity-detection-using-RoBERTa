Well past midnight it was.

All of the Bardy castle residents had gone to bed.

The windows were barred and the iron gate locked, all of a sudden develish shouts woke the sleepers from their dreams.

Jozsef Bardy asked, "What is that sound?", jumping from bed and running to the window.

"The Olahok!"[8] said a hussar, who had hurried to his master's chambers upon hearing the screams.

"The Olah! The Olah!" rang out through the corridors from the horrified servants.

From the lighting of a small amount of torches, a terrifying group was outside the windows, armed with sickle and hatchets, as they waved their weapons casting fear upon the insiders.
