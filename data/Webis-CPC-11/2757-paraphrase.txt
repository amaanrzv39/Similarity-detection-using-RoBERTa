Listen to what I must say. The swan mates not with the swallow, and I will seldom wed beneath me. Prove that your love is not presumption. Show yourself my peer. For I could love a brave and valiant knight before whose spear men bowed as to a king, nor would I ask his parentage, prouder far to know that my children took their nobleness from a self-made nobleman. But a weeping, love-sick page! No! Go, fight and battle--show me something that you do that I can love. Meantime I look for such a lover, and I care not if his name be Guy the page."
