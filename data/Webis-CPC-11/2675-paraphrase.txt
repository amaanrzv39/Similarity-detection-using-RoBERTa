Mr. Elliot said: Gentlemen of the Convention: With gratitude of the compliments you paid my state has led me to respond to your invitation. It is here gentlemen that I stand, together with my colleagues from other States as a demonstration of an achieved fact of American emancipation, as an illustration of management of the Americans and also as a living breathing example of justice of America.

The speeches are only a part of the introduction. An expression of gratitude and faithfulness, a recognition of the immediate needs was delivered with grace and style that impressed and influence a heart felt reception. The Academy's applause was heard echoing all through out the assembly.
