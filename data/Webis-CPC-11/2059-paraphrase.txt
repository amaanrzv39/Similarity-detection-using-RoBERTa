Though dramatic in form a poem is not continuously, directly, and compactly dramatic in its movement. A poem cannot be converted into a play without radical change in its structure and diction. Unfortunately, in the eyes of those votaries, a poem cannot be and never will be converted into a play without significant sacrifice of its contents, its comprehensive scope, its poetry, and its ethical meaning. In the poem it is the Man who predominates not the Fiend.
