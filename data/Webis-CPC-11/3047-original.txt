If not arrested, mildew will soon strip
a plant of its foliage. Whenever a whitish dust, as if flour had been sprinkled upon them,
appears upon the leaves, particularly those of the Rose, and its leaves curl up, it is evident
that the plant is attacked by mildew, and some remedy must be at once applied to prevent the
spread of the trouble. Several excellent remedies are used by florists and gardeners for the
prevention and cure of mildew. None of these are more effective than the following, which,
if applied in time, before the disease has become so bad as to be beyond help, will very surely
arrest it. Take three pounds each, of Flowers of Sulphur and Quick-lime, put these together
and add sufficient hot water to slake the lime.
