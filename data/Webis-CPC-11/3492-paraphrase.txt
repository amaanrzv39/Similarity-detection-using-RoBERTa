Weingarten spoke to Rosa of the fiendish whispers that misled his soul and the whispers of gold rewards of fortune and of eternal gratitude that the tempters whispered of thus making him sell his honour and becoming a traitor.This was all done in quest for the gold thus becoming what he is now.

Rosa asks him of the danger that threatens him to which he hoardely saya that pucishment for being a traitor.He then asks Rosa for the wine so that he can gain strength to go to the king.

On being questioned by Rosa as to why at this early hour, he asks her if he has not been with the king often at this hour when he would convey important news or despatched to the king.Rosa leaves the room only to return immediately with the bottle of wine he asks her for and thus fills a glass.

He rose his toast to the king and rejoices taking a deep breath feeling his blood feeling freely through the veins.
Brushing his hair in front of a glass and planting as kiss on Rosa's pale shaking lips, he left the room, walking hurriedly through the empty halls and chambers without being stopped as there were none.

Deesen was seated in the king's antechamber having breakfast.On being asked by Weingarten on whereabouts of the king, he replies that the king is up like the sun in the sky.

Weingarten then expresses his wish to meet the king with some important news to be conveyed.Deesen returns from the king's chamber after coveying the message and allows him in.

Weingarten ushers in to find the king seated in an arm chair with windows opened to let in fresh summer air.Amalthea, the king's white greyhound lay at his feet with soft black eyes.
