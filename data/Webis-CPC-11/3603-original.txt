One tribe cannot free the whole world from the yoke. What
good have we done by slaughtering and burning Roman legions except to bring out others, larger
and stronger? If it was to help Vespasian that we have fought so vigorously, Vespasian is master
of the world. If we are challenging Rome--what an infinitesimal fraction of the human race
we Batavians are! We must remember what burdens Raetia and Noricum and all Rome's other allies
bear. From us they levy no tribute, only our manhood and our men.[554] That is next door to
freedom. And, after all, if we have to choose our masters, it is less disgrace to put up with
Roman emperors than with German priestesses.' Thus the common people: the chieftains used more
violent language. 'It was Civilis' lunacy that had driven them to war. He wanted to remedy
his private troubles[555] by ruining his country. The Batavians had incurred the wrath of heaven
by blockading Roman legions, murdering Roman officers, and plunging into a war which was useful
for one of them and deadly for the rest. Now they had reached the limit, unless they came to
their senses and openly showed their repentance by punishing the culprit.'

Civilis was well aware of their changed feelings and determined to      26 forestall them.
He was tired of hardship, and he felt, besides, that desire to live which so often weakens
the resolution of the bravest spirits. He demanded an interview. The bridge over the river
Nabalia[556] was broken down in the middle, and the two generals advanced on to the broken
ends. Civilis began as follows: 'If I were defending myself before one of Vitellius' officers,
I could expect neither pardon for my conduct nor credence for my words. Between him and me
there has been nothing but hatred.
