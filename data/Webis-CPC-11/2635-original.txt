The attitude of the expert best qualified to judge is still one of suspicion
towards Aldus. In his most recent article,[72] Professor Merrill declares that Keil’s remarks[73]
on the procedure of Aldus in the part of Book X already edited by Avantius, Beroaldus, and
Catanaeus might safely have been extended to cover the work of Aldus on the entire body of
the Letters. He proceeds to subject Aldus to a new test, the material for which we owe to Merrill’s
own researches. He compares with Aldus’s text the manuscript parts of the Bodleian volume,
which are apparently transcripts from the Parisinus (= I);[74] in them Budaeus with his own
hand (= i) has corrected on the authority of the Parisinus itself, according to Merrill, the
errors of his transcriber.
