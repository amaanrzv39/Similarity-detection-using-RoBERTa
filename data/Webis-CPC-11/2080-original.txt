“’Tis distance lends enchantment to the view,” says the poet Campbell; and
this prospect, slightly undulating, with extensive woods barring it at intervals, and village
spires rising from their midst, seen through the marvellously clear atmosphere which we often
enjoy, is a sight worth seeing.

An old writer {27c} describes the air as being “crass, and full of rotten harrs”; and Drayton,
in his “Polyolbion” {28a} speaks of the “unwholesome ayre, and more unwholesome soyle”; but
that condition of things has long ago passed away.
