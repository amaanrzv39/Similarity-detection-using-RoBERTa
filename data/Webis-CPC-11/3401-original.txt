subject; and in the close, his hearers remember well how affectionately and solemnly he said:
"Dearly beloved and longed for, I now begin another year of my ministry among you; and I am
resolved, if God give me health and strength, that I will not let a man, woman, or child among
you alone, until you have at least heard the testimony of God concerning his Son, either to
your condemnation or salvation. And I will pray, as I have done before, that if the Lord will
indeed give us a great outpouring of his Spirit, He will do it in such a way that it will be
evident to the weakest child among you that it is the Lord's work, and not man's. I think I
may say to you, as Rutherford said to his people, 'Your heaven would be two heavens to me.'
And if the Lord be pleased to give me a crown from among you, I do here promise in his sight,
that I will cast it at his feet, saying, 'Worthy is the Lamb that was slain!

some saying, "I am of Paul; and others, I of Cephas." Those recently converted were apt to
regard their spiritual father in a light in which they could regard none besides. But Mr. M'Cheyne
had received from the Lord a holy disinterestedness that suppressed every feeling of envy.
Many wondered at the single-heartedness he was enabled to exhibit.
