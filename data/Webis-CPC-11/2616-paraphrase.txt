Before America, India spoke a different tongue. It is another country that speaks two languages.

The Religion of Business 

Hanging on the wall in the house where I am living,there is a vintage poster. It is a coloured picture, showing one young, attractive couple and one elderly couple. The elderly woman is holding an hour glass and and her partner is leaning on a walking stick. Below it reads:

"My father and mother that go so stuping to your grave, Pray tell me what good I may in this world expect to have?"

"My son, the good you can expect is all forlorn, Men doe not gather grapes from of a thorn."

Sometimes I think that the new and old worlds attitude to each other is symbolised by this inscription.
