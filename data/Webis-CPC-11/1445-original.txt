Though my grandmother was only a farmer's daughter, her parents were well-to-do in their own
line of life, and at various times helped my grandfather with sums of money; but the fact remained

marriage may have had some connection with the complete and permanent estrangement that existed
between Gilbert Hamerton and his brother, the squire of Hellifield Peel.
