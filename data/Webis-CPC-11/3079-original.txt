What is the evidence?
The learned District Attorney thought proper to suggest to the Court that there was further
evidence which might be presented in another stage of this proceeding. That, I am sure, fell
with as little weight upon the mind of the Commissioner as it would if we, on the other hand,
had said, as is the fact, that we have a large amount of evidence that might yet be presented
in behalf of Mr. Davis. This is not a game of brag! It is not upon evidence that is not here,
but upon evidence that is here, that this case is to be decided. Here has been mortified pride,
here has been fear, here has been the dread spectre of Executive power, stalking across the
scene, appalling the hearts, and disabling the judgments of men.
