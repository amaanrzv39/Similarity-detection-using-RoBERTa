We first went to a town which it was well worth our while to see, and which must have been,
as near as I can guess, quite in the heart of this land. It was built with straight streets
which ran in cross lines.

But I must own, when I came home to the place of my birth, I was much struck to hear my friends
say such fine things of the wealth and trade of these parts of the world, for I saw and knew
that the men were a mere herd or crowd of mean slaves. What is their trade to ours, or to that
of France and Spain? What are their ports, with a few junks and barks, to our grand fleets?
One of our large ships of war would sink all their ships, one line of French troops would beat
all their horse, and the same may be said of their ports, which would not stand for one month
such a siege as we could bring to bear on them.
