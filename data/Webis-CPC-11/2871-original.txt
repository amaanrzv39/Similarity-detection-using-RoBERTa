In considering the operation of the two last rubrics, it must be remembered--I. That the Prayer-Book
gives the Curate no authority to dismiss non-communicants.--2. That the system of separating
the communicants from the rest of the congregation, which underlies the rubrics in the earlier
part of the office, has generally ceased to be observed.--3. That the order for signifying
the names of intending communicants, at least some time the day before, has fallen into abeyance.--4.
That the Curate has no opportunity of interrupting the Service for the purpose of making inquiry
among the congregation of their individual intentions in this respect. The Curate, therefore,
has no means of obtaining information whereon to exercise the discretion to which this rubric
refers.
