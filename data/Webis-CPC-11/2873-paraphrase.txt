The universal source of the art and rite of Osiris is the forceful, world-wide wish for that the life of Nature which looked like dead should inhabit again. This universal emotional element it is that makes art and rite in their beginnings well-nigh indistinguishable. Both, to commence with, exact reproduce an play-act, but not at the commencing for the sake of the copy. Only when the sensitivity deceases down and is lost does the exact reproduce become an end in itself, a simple mimicry.

It is this heading down way, this descending of making to mimicry, that makes us now-a-days consider of rite as a unexciting and schematic thing. Because a rite has finished to be trusted in, it does not in the slightest chase that it will finish to be done. We have to imagine with all the immense forces of habit.
