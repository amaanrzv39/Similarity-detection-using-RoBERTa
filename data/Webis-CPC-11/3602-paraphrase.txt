There is no deficit in celebration, however. On Christmas Eve, the churches are thronged and there are banquets and dances going on everywhere. In the cities, the small boys entertain themselves by setting off fireworks. During the Christmas week, dances are frequent and in the nation they continue sometimes for days to the mournful accompaniment of a portable keyboard wind instrument and large drums. December 28th, Holy Innocents' Day, is All Fools' Day, instead of April 1st. It is being reasoned that just as the innocents of Herod's Day is made to suffer, so the innocents of this age should be persecuted. Many are the tricks committed and the small boy is in his magnificence.

On New Year's Eve, many families welcome their friends. There is generally a very good time and the New Year is introduced in with fireworks and other noises.

The great day of the year for the children is January 6th, the feast of epiphany or Three Kings' Day as it is called in Santo Domingo. Just as the three wise men from the East brought gifts to the infant Christ in ages past, so they now make the rounds and leave gifts for deserving children, thus taking the place of our Santa Claus. The containers they choose for the good things they deliver are either the children's slippers, shoes or boxes made ready by the little ones. For weeks before the eagerly awaited day, letters are written to the Kings, explaining what gifts would be acceptable and are given to the parents who undertake to convey them.
