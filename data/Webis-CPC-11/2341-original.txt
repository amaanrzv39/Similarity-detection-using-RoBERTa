But whilst all this debauchery was going on amongst some of our soldiers, I will give a word
of credit to a great many of the more respectable, who were trying as much as lay in their
power to stop the ferociousness of the same. That morning I met many about, who said they were
sorry to think that the soldiers could not carry it on without going to such excesses as they
did, respectable houses being ransacked from top to bottom, with no regard to the entreaties
of the few inhabitants who remained within the walls.
