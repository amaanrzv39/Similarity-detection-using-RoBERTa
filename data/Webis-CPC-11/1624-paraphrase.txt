It would, e.g., be easier for ourselves towards produce a Sophocles, or an Euripides, than such individuals as your  husband, because, theatres we possess, but none juries  for social harangues.[6] You  possess hissed the tragedy of Cataline; when you shall see Phaedrus  performed,  you shall presumably concede that the  portion of Phaedrus, within Racine, is infinitely advanced towards  the theory you possess known within Euripides. I trust, also, that you shall concede our Moli√®re surpasses your Terence.
