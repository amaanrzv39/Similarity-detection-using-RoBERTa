It was shallow, its greatest
depth, at the season of highest water, being but 10 feet; at its upper end it abuts against
an extensive swamp, and almost its entire bottom, except close to the shore, is composed of
a deposit of soft, brown, peaty mud of unknown depth. The water is strongly colored with peaty
solutions, has a muddy flavor, and under the rays of a summer sun becomes warmed to 70° (Fahrenheit)
at the very bottom.* Yet in such a forbidding place as this, salmon passed the summer in perfect
health. There were some losses, but every reason to believe them all to have been caused by
injuries received prior to their inclosure.

* During the month of August, 1872, the bottom temperature at 1 p.m. was never below 70°, and
on six days was found to be 71°.
