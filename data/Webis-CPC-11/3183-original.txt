The rooms in the dwelling houses have always been small and dark, and in early times
without chimneys. Within such cramped limits it was inconvenient for the men to practice any
of the arts they knew, especially weaving, which could have been carried on out of doors, as
is done still occasionally, but subject to many interruptions. It is possible that a class
of kivas was designed for such ordinary purposes, though now one type of room seems to answer
all these various uses. In most of the existing kivas there are planks, in which stout loops
are secured, fixed in the floor close to the wall, for attaching the lower beam of a primitive
vertical loom, and projecting vigas or beams are inserted into the walls at the time of their
construction as a provision for the attachment of the upper loom poles.
