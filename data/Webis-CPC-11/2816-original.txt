The Denounced, The
Mayor of Windgap, The Ghost Hunter (by Michael Banim), and The Smuggler followed in quick succession,
and were received with considerable favour. John Banim, meanwhile, had become much straitened
in circumstances. In 1829 he went to France, and while he was abroad a movement to relieve
his wants was set on foot by the English press, headed by John Sterling in The Times. A sufficient
sum was obtained to remove him from any danger of actual want, and to this government added
in 1836 a pension of Â£150. He returned to Ireland in 1835, and settled in Windgap Cottage,
a short distance from Kilkenny; and there, a complete invalid, he passed the remainder of his
life, dying on the 13th of August 1842.
