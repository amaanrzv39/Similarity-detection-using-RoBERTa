A few bilingual inscriptions have furnished valuable clues; but the world still eagerly awaits
the coming of a new Champollion to unlock the doors of the treasure-house. Winckler himself
died in 1913; but in 1915 the Austrian Professor Hrozny startled the world by proclaiming his
conviction that Hittite was an Indo-European language. Whether or no his contention is confirmed,
orientalists of both hemispheres are hot in pursuit, and it is no rash prophecy that within
a decade scholars will read Hittite as they now read cuneiform and hieroglyphics, and new chapters
of incalculable importance will be added to the story of the Ancient East.

The recovery of the political and religious history of the empires surrounding Palestine has
run parallel with the application of critical methods to the Jewish scriptures. To read Ewald's
History of the People of Israel, which was regarded as dangerous by pious folk in the middle
of last century, is to realize the progress of Semitic studies. The great revolution in our
conception of the Old Testament which rendered Ewald out of date was accomplished by Wellhausen's
Prolegomena to the History of Israel. That the arrangement of the Canon was utterly misleading,
that the Prophets were earlier than the priestly code and that the Psalms for the most part
were later than both, was proclaimed in the writings and lectures of Vatke and Graf, Kuenen
and Reuss; but it was not till their discoveries were confirmed and elaborated by Wellhausen
that they won their way, and it was generally recognized that their reconstruction alone rendered
the religious development of the Jews intelligible.
