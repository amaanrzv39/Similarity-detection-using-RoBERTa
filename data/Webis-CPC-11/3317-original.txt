The
division led by the king offered a brief resistance; the rest of the line yielded at once to
the Roman onset. A few standards and arms, a handful of prisoners, were all that the victors
had to show for their triumph. The nimble enemy had disappeared beyond all hope of capture
or pursuit.

After a time news was brought that the king had made for the southern desert with a fraction
of his mounted troops and the Roman deserters, whose despair ensured their loyalty. He had
shut himself up in Thala,[1097] a large and wealthy town to which his treasures and his children
had already been transferred. This city lay some thirteen miles east of the oasis of Capsa,
and a dismal and waterless desert stretched between the Romans and the refuge of the king.
No Roman army had at any part of the campaign attempted to penetrate such trackless regions,
and the court at Thala may have believed even this foretaste of the desert to be an adequate
protection against an enemy which clung to towns and cultivated lands and relied, in the cumbrous
manner of civilised warfare, on organised lines of communication. But the news that Jugurtha
had at last occupied a position, the strength of which, together with the presence of his family
and treasures within its walls, might supply a motive for a lengthy residence within the town
and even suggest the resolution of holding it against every hazard, fired Metellus with a hope
which the awkward political situation at Rome must have made more real than it deserved to
be. The end of the war might be in sight, if he could only cross that belt of burning land.
His plan was rapidly formed.
