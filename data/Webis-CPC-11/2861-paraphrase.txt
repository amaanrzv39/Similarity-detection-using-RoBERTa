United States Signal Service has been in operation since last eight or ten years, with about more than two hundred men, who have been closely monitoring the weather day after day. It is spread all over United states, from Maine to California, and from the Gulf of Mexico to the Northwestern lakes. These men send messages of the weather at the same time every day by telegraph to the main office at Washington. Here the different reports are scrutined, and an they report the forcast for next twenty-four hours or more expected in different sections of the country, which is then published in the daily newspapers and at all the post-offices.
