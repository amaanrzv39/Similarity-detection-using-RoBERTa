I have certain encounters with Father st.John in the recesses of the boot- room . At that time he managed to apply the birch with much considerable  freedom on me with his powerful arm.As the encounters were not so frequent and after the immediate effect  the incident was fogotten. But at the end of the year when the school accounts were rendered my father was surprised to find an item in it. It is the charges for the birches at the rate of a half a crown each. He asked me  explanation for it. I said him I am not responsible for it. If you want further explanation you must ask Father St. John. I know that my father will be supplied with enough explanation if he had contacted him. After my visits in many countries I have met many of my school mates who are holding high positions in the world. They were all thankful for the old school at Edgbaston. Among the Ex-students one was now the Viceroy of Ireland.
          When my elder brothers left the Oratory the school where there is much  freedom,my father must have thought that it is much better to send me to a college where the rules are stricter.He must have thought that twenty-two and six pences for birches  have given me a better life.
