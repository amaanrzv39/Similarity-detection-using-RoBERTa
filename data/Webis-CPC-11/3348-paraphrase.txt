In the south of Scotland, a legend, almost word for word the same as the previous one, is told of an old castle there, except that instead of the Danes, the old warrior and his sons are called Pechts. After the slaughter of their children the old man's eyes went out, and he is left to drag out a miserable existence: live to great old age, and one day, when all the generation that fought with him are over, he listens to men young people celebrating the feats of strength performed by one of them, the old Pecht calls for the winner, and asks you to leave feeling your wrist, and compliance with fakes young man with his request, but puts a line of iron-bar the old man's hand instead of your wrist, old lace Pecht iron rod in two with his fingers, silently watching the audience wondering, "is a bit gey cartilage and bone is not much on it yet . The story is told in the second volume of Chambers Edinburgh Journal, first series, I think, but I have the volume at hand for reference. The similarity between the two legends is curious and interesting.
