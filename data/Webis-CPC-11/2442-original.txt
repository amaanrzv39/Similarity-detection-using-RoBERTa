"BEATA MOCUDA."

The renowned bishop, Carthach, commonly called Mochuda, was of the territory of Ciarraighe
Luachra [North Kerry] and of the race of Fergus Mac Roigh.

The illustrious bishop, who is generally known as Mochuda, was of the Ciarraighe Luachra; to
be exact--he was of the line of Fergus Mac Roigh, who held the kingship of Ulster, till the
time that he gave the kingship to a woman for a year and did not get it back when the year
was over. His descendants are now to be found throughout various provinces of Ireland.
