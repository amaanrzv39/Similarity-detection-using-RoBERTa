I never heard of your Colonel
Smith--I'm not drawing up real estate lots or plots of any kind. Thirdly, I solemnly swear
by Minos, Alianthus, Rhododendron, Nebuchadnezzar, and all the infernal gods, that if you touch
a hair of our heads I'll see Colonel Smith--I'll map the whole property and advertise it in
every newspaper in New-York and Boston till it brings ten thousand dollars an acre. Now sail
in--dog or no dog--we'll settle you, any how.'

The glare of fury in our visitor's eyes died away as he listened to this oration.
