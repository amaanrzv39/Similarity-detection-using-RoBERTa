She had full control over us and i often doubted whether she was our propertly or we hers. At her will the whip cracked, or lay harmlessly by the side of the horse, the largest top hummed, or was silent;  She moved us from place to place, and exhibited or hid us at her pleasure. she was always extremely careful of our health and looks, and her life seemed so entirely devoted to us and to our advantage. Her habits were the same throughout the day and did not vary at all, that after watching her for some time i felt myself perfectly acquainted with her.

One day a girl stopped at our stall. "what a splendid doll" she exclaimed after pointing at a waxen one which was quite beautiful and was prominet in our tribe.
