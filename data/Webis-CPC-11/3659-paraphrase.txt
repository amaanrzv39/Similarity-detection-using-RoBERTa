In A History "

Willie GLAIKIT

(Continued Mr Grierson), the only thing remarkable is that he was just a lucky man he was a lad thochtless. After leaving school, he's cast aside Greek and Latin, and it was easy to do because it was small, but has never learned, and recalled less than that because he paid attention both little to onything he did, that what he took to heart one day, he looked ahead. Despite a "remonstrances a" his friends would haud Willie naething but it would be a sailor. Weel, he was on a board, "an American trader, and for many years there was naething heard" concerning it, but accidents which have happened, and all through his glaikitness. Sometimes he was fa'ing owre a boat, and was largely drowned and ither times, I heard a "fa'ing him headlong into the ship hold, a dance to" tumbling overboard in the middle a "great Atlantic Ocean and a last," fa'ing of the mast on deck and legs broken. It was the luckiest thing that ever happened to him. It made him think, and it gied leisure to do so, he was scheduled for twelve weeks and, while some "time, he applied himself navigating the elements a" science which I've trained. Soon after recovery, he received a command ship, and was very lucky, and for several years, he was the sole owner of a number of vessels, and is reputed to be very rich.
