Many of the masters
even in those parishes where the slaves were declared emancipated sent their most valuable
slaves to Alabama and Texas, some of them themselves fleeing with them. In parishes far removed
from Union headquarters, news of the Emancipation Proclamation did not reach the slaves until
long after it had been issued. Even then, in many cases, the proclamation had to be read at
the point of the sword, federal soldiers compelling the slave owners to tell their chattels
the news.[99]

From the time of the accession of General Banks to 1876, the history of Louisiana becomes a
turmoil of struggle, centering around the brother in black.[100] It is no longer romance; it
is grim war, and the colored man is the struggle, not the cause of it. Political parties in
1862 were many and various. The Free State party was in favor of abolishing slavery, but wanted
representation based altogether on the white population. This was opposed by the Union Democrat
party, which repudiated secession, but wished slavery continued or rather revived, believing
that emancipation was only a war measure, and that after cessation of hostilities, slavery
could be reestablished. But the plans of both parties fell to the ground.[101] The colored
man became more and more of a political factor from day to day.

Cognomens here too proved to be another difficulty. Louisiana had two classes of colored men,
freedmen and free men, a delicate, but carefully guarded distinction, the latter distinctly
aristocratic.
