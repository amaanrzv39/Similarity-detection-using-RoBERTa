It would, of course,
greatly increase the number attending high schools--holding those who now, because of lack
of interest in the work offered, drop out of school entirely and thus swell the ranks of unskilled
and unintelligent labor. And that is greatly worth while. My own feeling is, too, that out
of the greatly increased attendance of the high school an even larger number than at present
would find their way to the university, and that they would be better equipt in point of view
and purpose than are many who enter under present conditions. This suggestion is made not to
keep boys and girls out of the university, but to send them there with a purpose.

But there is oftentimes a misapprehension as to these two possible programs for the high schools.
