A large part of it I have never seen. It is kept in the boxes in which it was sent
to the academy. Where is the scientific apparatus? Where is it?

"The rooms for the pupils are not large enough. Two students live by day and by night in one
small chamber. The passages between the rooms are too narrow. The recitation rooms are too
small and not well ventilated. The teachers have no adequate support, and could readily obtain
much larger salaries for far less work in other institutions. For such reasons the academy
asks for an enlarged endowment. It needs $150,000 for its new buildings. Thus far it has received
promise of only $36,000. If it receive a generous increase of funds it will flourish; if it
does not, it will not flourish as it should. Other institutions will attract its scholars.
We cannot expect that future instructors will have a spirit of self-denial equal to that of
its present and past instructors.

"After his 7th of March speech, Daniel Webster said to the Bostonians, 'You have conquered
your climate, you have now nothing to do but to conquer your prejudices.' He meant that New
Englanders had overcome the laws of nature, which had provided them with little except ice
and granite; and nothing was left for them to conquer except their prejudices against the system
of slavery. Now the teachers of Abbot Academy have conquered themselves, and there is nothing
left for them to subdue except the laws of nature. They cannot subdue these laws.
