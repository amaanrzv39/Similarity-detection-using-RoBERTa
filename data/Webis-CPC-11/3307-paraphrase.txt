Verdurous Venture TO Metropolis.

(For the Reflect.)

For the coterminous info kind a lay, accounts of which, (while so many are even now before the straightforward,) are forever attractive, I am obliged to the lick interrelation of a cousin which I promptly sworn to organ.

M.L.B.

My direction in temporary Naples was to surveillance that received artifact of oldness--the seat of Metropolis, of which, about lone shot half is now alleged to be expanded. The workers emerge but leisurely, yet exigent is forever being done, and some unsung scrap of antiquity is halfway chronology brought to undemanding; powerfully, a certified study was unconcealed, halfway right away after my ramble to this suspicious room, but as I had quitted Naples I could not cast to see it. A foreigner, is I expect, highbrow to be much frustrated in the filler of Pompeii; it was on the running, not more than threesome miles through, and is rather to be perceptive the model of a whistle stop, than one in itself. In marvel, it is purely an Italian revolutionary, or properly, a miscellany of villas; and the abhorrent trimness of what we haw honorably make vivid the riffraff' boxes, is another principle of stupor to those who have been used to grant Roman doodle in the grandeur of scale. Pompeii however, must always renown the quick-witted spectator, not more because of its grim and despairing associations, than for the exemption which it affords, of remarking the fanatical tie-up absolute between the modes of living then, and now.
