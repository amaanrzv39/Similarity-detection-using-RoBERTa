In our time we have a new ideal, a new and maybe a higher development of
intellectual art, and as great a soul as Titian's might to-day reach farther towards the reconciled
perfections of graphic art: but what he did no one can now do; the glory of that time has passed
away,--its unreasoning faith, its wanton instinct, revelling in Art like children in the sunshine,
and rejoicing in childlike perception of the pomp and glory which overlay creation, unconscious
of effort, indifferent to science,--all gone with the fairies, the saints, the ecstatic visions
which framed their poor lives in gold. Only, still reflecting the glory, as eastern mountains
the sunken sun, came a few sympathetic souls kindling into like glow, with faint perception
of what had passed from the whole world beside.
