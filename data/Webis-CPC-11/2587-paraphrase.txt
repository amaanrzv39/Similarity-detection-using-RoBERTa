Tolerating this guy is like tolerating that gnawing feeling in your gut when you have a guilty conscience.  But at least you know that gut feeling speaks the truth, whereas this guy is a pathological liar.  He has no concept of truth.  He will not lie to cover for you, that would be a sin, unless you pay him, then it's not a sin.  

A person who receives special consideration because of who he is, or who he knows, or who his relatives are, is like one who puts his pants on backwards.  He may look presentable, but the people mock him behind his back.  He has not earned the respect of his position.
