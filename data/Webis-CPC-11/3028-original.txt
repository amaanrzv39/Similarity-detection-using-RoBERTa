Hast thou forgotten
  When that most beautiful and blameless boy,
  The prettiest piece of innocence that ever
  Breath'd in this sinful world, lay at thy feet,
  Slain by thy pampered minion, and I knelt
  Before thee for redress, whilst thou--didst never
  Hear talk of retribution? This is justice,
  Pure justice, not revenge!--Mark well, my lords,
  Pure, equal justice. Martin Ursini
  Had open trial, is guilty, is condemned,
  And he shall die!

  Colonna. Yet listen to us--

  Rie. Lords,
  If ye could range before me all the peers,
  Prelates, and potentates of Christendom,--
  The holy pontiff kneeling at my knee,
  And emperors crouching at my feet, to sue
  For this great robber, still I should be blind
  As justice.
