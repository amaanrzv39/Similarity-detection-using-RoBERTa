(Sidenote:  First Flamboyance)

To begin with they are very ill from the self-righteous absurdity as they revel in the public display of their worship and call to Jehu, Come and see how perfect I am for the Lord of hosts: music draws your attention to their presence, the magnificent windows publicly show their good deeds, they keep history written upon the walls for all to see.  They see themselves more holy than Whom they worship as their pride in false suffering glows more around them than what is really in their spirits.
