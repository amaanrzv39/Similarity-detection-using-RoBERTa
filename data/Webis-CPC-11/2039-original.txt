One of the rule-proving exceptions is Charles Crozat Converse, who has delved into
many philosophies. An example of his versatility of interest is his coining of the word "thon"
(a useful substitute for the ubiquitous awkwardness of "he or she" and "his or her"), which
has been adopted by the Standard Dictionary.

Converse' ancestry is American as far back as 1630. Converse was born at Warren, Mass., October
7, 1832. After being well grounded in English and the classics, he went, in 1855, to Germany.
