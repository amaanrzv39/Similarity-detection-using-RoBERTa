In a civil court his chronicle and description of the whiskers would be handled with derisive laughter.

Also, if we agree that Weichmann's narrative of the whiskers is true, and that is was not sufficient to awaken vibes that something was wrong, he says that, around the same time, he proceede to go to Surratt's room and discovered Payne playing with bowie knives, and encircled with guns and spurs, while perched on the bed with Surratt.  It was witnessed by Miss Honora Fitzpatrick that Weichmann was regarded by Mrs. Surratt as "more like a son than a friend."  How horrible to treat someone that close to you in that manner!  An excellent reason for not letting Mrs. Surratt aware of everything, would be if be a person was conscience-stricken and had aided in the caper or plan for the abduction of the President.
