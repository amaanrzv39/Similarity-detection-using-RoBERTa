Sir Tristram said that he was going to lack him that day. Sir Palomides said: Do not trust me, because I may not perform as I performed yesterday. Then Sir Tristram told Sir Gareth, I must trust you. I will pray that you will be near me at all times so that you can save me. Sir Gareth said that he did not have to worry because he was not going to fail him.
