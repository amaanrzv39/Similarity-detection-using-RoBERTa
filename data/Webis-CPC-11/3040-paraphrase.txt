Messrs. Puttick and Simpson (191. Piccadilly) will sell during Tuesday and Wednesday by a choice Collection of Autographed letters containing many letters that are very rare and chosen from Upcott's Collection. We are unable to try to make particular the numerous interesting lots that you can find in the current collection, but we recommend the Catalogue for the great way the various letters are arranged and described.
