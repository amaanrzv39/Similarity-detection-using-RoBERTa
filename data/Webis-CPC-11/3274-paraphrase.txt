The hours of prayer were not infringed as long as the work might be anything that wanted doing. St. Benedict's sons working and willing in quiet love with agriculture, scholarship, education, art and handicrafts have been done perfectly. The greatest constructive minds of christendom regarded as a reasonable way of life. The frame in the laftiest human faculties could grow and man's spirit achieve that harmony with God, which is its target. This life was to be social and it was in the initial the busy life of an farm of Italian who lived in monastic families and between the rule and inspiration not of a Master but of an Abbot. A Father was the spiritual parent of his monks and eager to train them in the humility, obedience, gentle suppleness of character and self-deniel, which are the authentic fruits of the Spirit. This seems to me has something still to say to us. some expression of criticism and censure to administer to our hurried and muddled existence, our failure to find time for reality. We can find out in it and if we look all those marks of regenerate life of the history has shown to us as normal, the preeminent aim, the balanced career of action and contemplation, the power of creative, and above all the principle of social purposes and an active adherent.
