In the next eight years 'King Henry v.,''The Merry Wives of Windsor,''As you don<t dislinke it.''Hamlet,''Twelfth Night,''Measure for Measure,''Othello,''Macbeth,' and 'King Lear'. In this list are the four great tragedies in which his genious culminated. Then came 'Troilus and Cressida.' 'Timon of Athens,''Julius Caesar.''Antony and Cleopetra,''Cymbeline,''King Henry Vlll.,''The Tempest,''The winter's Tale,' and 'Coriolanus." If heed be paid to this order of the plays, it will be seen at once that a quotation from Shakespeare carries with it a very different degree of authority, according as it refers to the youth or the maturity of his mind. 
Indeed, when we reflect that between the production of "The Two Gentlemen of Verona" and "King Lear" there is only a space of fifteen years, we must admit that the history of the human intellect presents no other example of such marvellous progress; and if we note the giant strides by which it was made, we shall find that they all imply a progressive widening and deepening of soul, a positive growth of the nature of the man, until in Lear the power became supreme and becomes amazing. Mr. Verplanck considers the period when he produced his four great tragedies to be the period of his intellectual grandeur, as distinguished from an earlier period which he thinks shows the perfection of his merely poetic and imaginative power; but the fact would seem to be that his increasing greatness as a philosopher was fully matched by his increasing greatness as a poet, and that in the devouring swiftness of his onward and upward movement imagination kept abreast of reason.
