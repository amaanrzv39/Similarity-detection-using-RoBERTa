It's like this. If you're putting in a new window, and the springs on each window sash look the same, then that means the nails are different, or at least they look different. Standing on the bed, I looked over the headboard to stare at the window ledge. Putting my hand on the wooden ledge, I pressed down until I found the spring, and as I'd figured, it was an identical twin for all the other springs. Now I looked at the nail.
