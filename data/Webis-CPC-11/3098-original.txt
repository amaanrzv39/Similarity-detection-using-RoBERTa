Early as it was, Julia had risen, and was at
work. She had had her own pleasant anticipations of the fête--though she had not heard that
a rosière was to be crowned, much less that the honour was in store for herself--and had intended,
by commencing some hours earlier than usual, to have done her work so much the sooner, that
she might share the pleasures of the festal day. But all thoughts of work were quickly banished
by her eager visitors, who, touched even by the fact, that they had found her busy at the time
when all were holiday-making, embraced her, praised her, bade her prepare for coronation, wept,
laughed, chatted, clapped their hands, jumped, danced, and made such a bustle, that Widow Gostillon,
in some consternation, cried out from her chamber to know what was the matter.
