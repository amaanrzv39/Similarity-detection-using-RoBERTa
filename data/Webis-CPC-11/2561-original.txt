Now Mr. Davis being engaged in this unpopular cause,
Byrnes makes a remark which Mr. Minns thought was intended to irritate Mr. Davis.

He did not hear the first part, but it ended with "killing the negroes." Mr. Davis felt that
it was intended as a taunt to him. He answered him, "Then, on that principle, you ought to
have your throats cut." I have no doubt it was a logical conclusion from Mr. Byrnes' premises,
and nothing more.

Up to this point, what is the evidence against Mr. Davis? Am I not right in saying, nothing
whatever--nothing more than any man would be subject to, who acted as counsel?

The only remaining point is his passing out of the door, and his conduct in the entry.
