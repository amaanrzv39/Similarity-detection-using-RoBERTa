Only a few of the
elder Jews could read Hebrew, and their children could not understand one word of the language.
Must the little ones, therefore, grow up in ignorance of the Word of God?

This was impossible.  Here in the heathen city of Alexandria the Scriptures would be the only
safeguard of Jewish boys and girls.  'If the language of our children is Greek, then the Bible
must be translated into Greek, so that they all can understand it.'  So said these Jewish parents.

This was a wonderful proof of the Bible's living power.  The Jews had changed their language
and their country.  Thousands of the cleverest books ever written were within their reach--for
Alexandria had at this time the largest library in the world--yet all this made no difference;
without the written Word of God, they could not exist.
