We transported weighty furniture to the Upper Canada woods. The black walnut is much more beautiful compared to mahogany. Black walnut makes better looking furniture, and does not stain easily, which makes it easier to clean. Canadian leather makes for great shoes and clothes. Canadian leather looks like hide and lasts a long time. The currency for Canada compared to America is 5s to the dollar.
