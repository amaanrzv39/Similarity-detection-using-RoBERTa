It must be remembered that just because a slave ran away from his master and now he's on the run, that doesn't make him a bad guy or a criminal.

A couple of years ago, Massachusetts decided it wasn't criminal to chase after a slave and bring him back to his owner. He was just property. This law looked at slaves as property, just like some guy's cow or his horse, and this was how they saw things in those free states. It's just a question about whether or not the Southern man should be able to call that slave his property.
