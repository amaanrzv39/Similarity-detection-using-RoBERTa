He laughed; there couldn't have been anyone who hadn't "enjoyed that priviledge." Of course I've been priviledged through the years, but I've never had the fortune to see myself through another's eyes, so to speak.  "Unavoidable absence of Mr. GLADSTONE!" Hah.  I was perfectly incognito, dressed up as a Liberal Unionist, with a wig and glasses.  No one would ever be able to tell it was me in my getup.

It was fun, and so was my essay "Phoenician Elements in the Homeric Poems." What a fantastic name! How fashionable. I think I will print it for giving out among Workmen's Clubs and Radical Associations.  I might even appeal to those irrational Eight-Hour Men.  Maybe even KEIRHARDIE would want a leaflet?
