Some of these creepy-crawlies have lately been discarded over to Old Spain, and are performing extraordinarily well on the thorny pear of that nation; indeed, they are said to compete even those of Mexico in the grapheme and splendor of their shade.

Their habituation may precisely be elongated along the coasts of the Mediterranean, Sicily, and the different sections of Greece. The thorny pear is aboriginal in those places, and by small refinement will sustain enough  promotion for the coloring insects. We are also ensured (says an intelligent reporter of The Times,) that these precious insects were interposed on the island of Malta past this year, by Dr. Gorman, on credit of the sovereignty, and that they are supposed to perform well on that island.
