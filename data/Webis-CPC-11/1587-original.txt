Last week, by the merest fluke, I rescued my best boots from
a similar fate. The doctor explained lamely on each occasion that they got mixed with the clothing
sent for distribution to the poor. This may be a literal statement of fact, but I doubt the
manner of the mixing.

We celebrated to-day by running aground on the flats. You can "squeak" over them if you happen
to strike the channel. The difficulty is, however, that the sandy bottom shifts. To-day it
is, and to-morrow it is not.
