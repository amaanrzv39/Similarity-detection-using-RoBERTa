I go towards a region which is a bit of water-side Bristol, with a cut  of Wapping, a flavoring of Wolverhampton, and a garnish of Portsmouth, and I say, "Will YOU arrive and be idle with me?" And it answers, "No; for I am a great  import too vaporous, and a great  import too rusty, and a great import too muddy, and a great  import too discoloured altogether; and I possess ships towards burden,  and pitch and tar towards boil, and iron towards hammer, and steam towards get up, and smoke towards earn, and masonry   towards quarry, and fifty else unpleasant things towards do, and I can't be idle with you."
