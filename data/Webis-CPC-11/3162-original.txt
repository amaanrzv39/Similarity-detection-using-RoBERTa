Though he lacked the large grasp, the fertile
suggestiveness, of great scientific travellers like Humboldt, Darwin, and Alfred Russel Wallace,
he was curious, well informed, industrious, and sympathetic; and as he was the first trained
anthropologist to enter into personal relations with the Tasmanian blacks--a race now become
extinct under the shrivelling touch of European civilisation--his writings concerning them
have great value, quite apart from the pleasure with which they may be read. A couple of pages
describing Peron's first meeting with the aboriginals when out looking for water, and the amazement
of the savages on encountering the whites--an incident given with delightful humour, and at
the same time showing close and careful observation--will be likely to be welcomed by the reader.
