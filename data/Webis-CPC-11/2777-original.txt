It is in the considerable group of couples where the husband's work separates him but little
from the home that the pressure on the wife is most severe, and without the relief and variety
secured by his frequent absence. She has perhaps led a life of her own before marriage, she
knows how to be economically independent; now they occupy a small dwelling, they have, maybe,
one or two small children, they can only afford one helper in the work or none at all, and
in this busy little hive the husband and wife are constantly tumbling over each other. It is
small wonder if the wife feels a deep discontent beneath her willing ministrations and misses
the devotion of the lover in the perpetual claims of the husband.
