Stephan, now you have a career it would be horrible if you miss it, later you should not think and worry.Once you become a priest you are always priest. The catechism does teach that the sacrament of Holy Orders shall be received once and it imprints on the soul as a spiritual mark which can never be removed. Hence you must think before you decide, not later. It is a serious question, Stephen, might be your the salvation of your soul depends on your decision.
