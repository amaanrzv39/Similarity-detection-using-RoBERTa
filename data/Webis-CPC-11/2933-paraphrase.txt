Only the pile of debrises were seen  inplace of Nima's house , after the smoke disappeared completely.
The Sun was  sprinkling it's rays on the earth, at the end of the autumn, and  the   leaves were scattered everywhere,  but where can we find those  people  who enjoyed the spring season?

The  gloomy wind floated  gently   through the demolished walls and sprinkled the withered leaves all over the eleven grossy mounds

My heart was filled with sadness on the sorrowful incident  and my hand was losing it's grip on my pen
My sick heart wished  the  terror,  to be an imagination

I could request my honorable readers to lead  the life with love and not with frightful and tearful terror
