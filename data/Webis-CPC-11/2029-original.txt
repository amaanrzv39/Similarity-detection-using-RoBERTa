To sever them is to disintegrate the mystic core of his very being; to disregard
the triune image in which he was made. As art is symbolic of man himself, it addresses itself
to his whole being. Thus, man exists as:

     Soul-Spirit-Body: to which the corresponding senses are--

     Hearing-Seeing--Touching: the corresponding arts--

     Music-Painting-Sculpture. Poetry is no fourth art; it but embraces
     and embodies them all in its correspondent divisions of--

     Rhythm-Description-Form.
