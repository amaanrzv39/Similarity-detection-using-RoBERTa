Nuniz echoes the general sentiment when he writes
of the Khan's rescue of the Adil Shah, after his defeat at Raichur in 1520 A.D., as being effected

During this reign the Portuguese were busy establishing themselves at various places on the
coast, and they built several forts there for the protection of their trade. They had been
constantly at war with the Samuri of Calicut and other feudatories of Vijayanagar; but with
the Raya himself they were on terms of friendship, and in 1540 they ratified a treaty of peace
with the sovereigns of Bijapur and Ahmadnagar as well as with the Samuri.
