A person
not in trouble could not help but enjoy the glorious trip on the bosom of that immense inland
sea. But, although we were overjoyed to be once more in safety, and drawing nearer our homes,
yet memory was not sleeping, and we had too much to think off to permit our enjoying the trip
as it could be enjoyed. From Owen Sound we proceeded to Parkdale by train. Parkdale is a lovely
spot just outside of Toronto. I spent the afternoon there, and at nine o'clock that night left
for home.
