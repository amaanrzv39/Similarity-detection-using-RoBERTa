In Bologna, in the Palace of Messer Giovanni Bentivogli, the same man painted certain rooms
in competition with many other masters; but of these, since they were thrown to the ground
in the destruction of that palace, no further mention will be made. But I will not forbear
to say that, of the works that he executed for the Bentivogli, only one remained standing--namely,
the chapel that he painted for Messer Giovanni in S. Jacopo, wherein he wrought two scenes
of triumphal processions, which are held very beautiful, with many portraits.
