Their unpreparedness served to strengthen the arguments for the European method
of doing things. France, Germany, Italy, England, had found it necessary to do things at school.
Arguing from their experience, it was only a matter of time when American cities must follow
their example. Why not, therefore, begin at once to deal radically with the situation and give
school meals, school eyeglasses, etc.? Those who organized the Committee on the Physical Welfare
of School Children realized the danger of trying to settle so great a question with the little
definite information then available. If doing things at school were to be adopted as a principle
and logically carried out, vast sums must be added to the present cost of the public school
system.
