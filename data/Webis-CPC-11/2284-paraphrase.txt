THE AMERICA pruducts are manufactured on the same principle and often they are of equal quality. Mr. Edward Anthony of 205 Broadway, New York city, has manufactured, and sold cameras equivalent to the German and for which Voitlander instruments have not been accepted in exchange by the purchaser. 

The regular camera box (see fig. 5, a) varies in configuration to suit the tube, and is termed medium, half, or whole. Inside the box is a lever to help regulate the focus, and to enlarge or diminish the picture.
