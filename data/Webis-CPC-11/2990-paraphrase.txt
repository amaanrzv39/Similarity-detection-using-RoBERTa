Horse shoes are no good unless they are on the horse fulfilling their intended purpose. Mr. Knight reminds us of a common saying among the scholars, "You can measure Hercules by his shoes." 

After 14 years passed, Mr. Knight was in the process of publishing "The Stratford Edition", a new version of Shakespearean anecdotes used as examples for whatever point he was trying to make.  Again, he uses almost the same connotation, changed slightly, as he did 14 years earlier, comparing it to Theobald's version by writing:

It carries as much weight as that of Hercules on his horse.
