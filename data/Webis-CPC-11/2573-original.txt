Three asterisks prefixed to a title indicate the more or less permanent literary value of the
story, and entitle it to a place on the annual "Rolls of Honor." An asterisk before the name
of an author indicates that he is not an American. Cross references after an author's name
refer to previous volumes of this series. (H) after the name of an author indicates that other
stories by this author, published in American magazines between 1900 and 1914, are to be found
indexed in "The Standard Index of Short Stories," by Francis J. Hannigan, published by Small,
Maynard & Company, 1918. The figures in parentheses after the title of a story refer to the
volume and page number of the magazine.
