Some one possesses the vivacity of a harlequin--he is fuddled with animal spirits,
giddy with constitutional joy; in such a state, he must write or burst: a discharge of ink
is an evacuation absolutely necessary to avoid fatal and plethoric congestion. A musty and
limited pedant yellows himself a little among rolls and records, plunders a few libraries,
and, lo! we have an entire new work by the learned Mr Dunce, and that after an incubation of
only one month.
