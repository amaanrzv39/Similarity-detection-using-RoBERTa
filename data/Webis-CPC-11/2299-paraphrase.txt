It will rarely happen, however, that the installation must be recharged or inspected after nightfall. In order to do this in safety, a double window, unable of being opened, should be fitted in one wall of the house, as far as possible from the door, and in such a position that the light may fall on to all the required places. Outside this window may be balanced an ordinary hand- lantern burning oil or paraffin; or, preferably, round this window may be built a closed lantern into which some source of false light may be brought.
