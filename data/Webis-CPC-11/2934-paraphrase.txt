Treatment - When a bruise case comes to us, we must bathe it with hot water two to three times a day. In the cases, which are not very old, this treatment is sufficient and no other action is required. In case the bruise is swollen and hard or thick and it is not new one, then tincture of iodin must be applied each day on the affected part. In case of the snake bite, a straight cut should be made in the direction of the larger axis of the face of the swelling and a small piece of cotton should be inserted in the would till the bleeding is stopped. After that make a lotion of half a dram of Permanganate of potassium and 1 pint of distilled water. Apply this lotion on the wound a number of times each day.
