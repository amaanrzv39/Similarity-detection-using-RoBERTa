Th riverside  low lands are very fertile. I ever didn't heard about a barren  land near  riverside.  The soil of York-shire is famous for  cattle   as it is on river side of Humber. As it was on riverside lots of grass grown there can feed bulks of cattle.  The countries in Europe is also known for its fertility as they lie so low. In the case of Egypt it is known as the gift of Nile. We cannot compare the fertility of Egypt to another land. Because of this the soil suitable for an orchard is river side low plaine.
