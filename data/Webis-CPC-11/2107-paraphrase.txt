It is necessary if we want to honor the founder of Christianity that we ask and answer with honesty the hard questions. We need to decide whether the religion of Christ has disturbed the social order or whether it has fostered them.  It naturally influences society, but we must decide whether it has made humanity kinder or more evil and miserable.  If we don't address this, we are not honoring our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
