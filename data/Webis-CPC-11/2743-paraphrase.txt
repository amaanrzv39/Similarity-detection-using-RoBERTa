After analysing the water in the laboratory to know the required amount of lime and carbonate of soda needed for the total precipitation the heated water in the reservoir is mixed with lime and stirred  well. we have to make the alkaline test to know enough amount of lime is added or not. Alkaline test is dipping red litmus paper  for 1/4 minute in the mixture.  if enough lime is added  the red litmus will turn blue. After this a solution of carbonate of  soda is added and stirred well.
       After the precipitate has settled in the bottom  the pure water is drawn to the pure water reservoir.
