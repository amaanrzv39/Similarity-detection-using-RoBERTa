The English built them. Their shipwrights and carpenters, descended from a historic line of skilled craftsmen. Tiny crafts that were the primary transport through the wild uncharted tidewaters of Virginia. They had many uses, trade, fishing, exploration. Small handmade tools of iron have been found, thought to have been used by the boat builders in Jamestown.

THE POTTER

In Jamestown in 1955 a site was discovered containing pottery kilns. Nearby was a collection of utilitarian earthenware vessels, probably made between 1625 and 1640, which is clear proof that pottery was in production in the area for more that 300 years. Though utilitarian many of the pots have a certain symmetry and are not completely drab.
