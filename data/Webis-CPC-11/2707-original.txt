Sometimes a Cirro-Stratus cloud comes along and fastens itself to it parasitically.
It is one of our most picturesque forms of clouds.

Within the last two years we have twice observed in the city of New York, during the summer
afternoons, large masses of clouds coming over from the southwest, and hanging rather low,
which could not be well placed in any of the classes already described, or recognized as such
by meteorologists. They consisted of a great number of hemispherical forms of large diameter,
hanging vertically from a Stratus cloud or plane above them, and to which they appeared attached.
They were regular in shape, and very distinct; they barely touched each other, and were of
a gray color.
