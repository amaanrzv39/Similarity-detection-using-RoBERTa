"it is in my understanding that your heart is grieving by the thought that your child who is accustomed to a free and pampered life will experience a life of control and confinement among people she doesn't really know of. But my dear don't worry, fill your heart of thoughts that this experience will only benefit her. She might feel the pain, the hardness of this new life. But it will not be a meaningless suffering, it will do her good eventually; she will "sow in tears to reap in joy."
