These days it seems as though everyone eats to kill oneself. Wouldn’t it have been much better if people took care of their health in a much better way?
It’s an embarrassing as well as a funny fact that if you ask a guy to take in medicine for his malady, he will be willing, but at the same time, if you ask him to eat properly to maintain his health, he gives you a smile, in other words he is unwilling. Easy it is to swallow a pill, but tough it is to chew with leisure. People who spend a season of the year at Vichy will tell you its quite impossible to spend an extra five minutes everyday at luncheon time. They could actually enjoy these few minutes if they wonder  about the various illnesses that they are prone to with such unhealthy eating habits? They may realize it one day when they become non-functional.
