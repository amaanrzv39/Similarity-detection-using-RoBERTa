I can hardly hope to be forgiven, but the sacred truth is that "I have sinned."

All of this was uttered by a repentant woman.  At that time it was wholly unheared of by those most interested in that statement.  They only comprehenended that they were saved and that the child was theirs in truth.  Abundant, Great, for a moment and bewildering Joy!  Mr. Arbuthnot--his lovely wife, her own true boy (how could she have doubted for a moment that he was her only true boy!  You may have read that though through all of her tears, as much as they fell) the aged and half-stunned rector.  Yet as Mrs. Danby was speaking, and explaining while sobbing in each's other's arms, and praising God too, with broken voices, incoherent words, fervent, pious and grateful hearts.

The Taxes on Knowledge

To all appearance, the abolition of the taxes on the spread of knowledge through the media is only a matter of time.  The principal of these taxes is the Excise-duty, which as, we have repeatedly stated, acts most detrimentally on the issue of a cheap class of publications.  The duty next in this process, is the importance that charges on advertisements.  Our belief is that a relief from this taxation would be a prodigious advantage to all departments on trade, commerence, and numerous social interests.
