Nothing remained of the once noble four legged animal, which she called JACK, the horse, had lost not only the ornamental mane and tail but his head too, one fore and one hind leg; it appeared like a barrel with the paint scratched off, which was insecurely mounted upon a stand which had wheels.  In spite of this, he worked to the lost and proved that he was a faithful animal.  I was usually tied to his barrel by the baby, and Jack and I in my gilt coach with its four prancing piebalds, were made to go round and round the kitchen until our mistress was satisfied.

My enfeebled frame was affected, by the babyâ€™s treatment of me, where there was a roughness and want of ceremony, though gratifying from its cordiality.
