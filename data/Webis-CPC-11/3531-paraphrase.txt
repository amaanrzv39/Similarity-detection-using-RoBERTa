It seems to me that forgetfulness represents so great a loss of experience that, if I were to live my life over again, I would spend at least 30 minutes every day writing down the names and stories of the people I met, no matter how dull they seemed.

Imagine what kind of journal I would have today, if I had kept such a list starting with my friends in school, keeping it updated with news and making note of the event in their lives! Instead, of the two or three hundred boys I knew in school, I still know or can clearly recall only a tenth of them. Of the others, I know nothing. For a few years I remembered everyone clearly. I remembered the smiles of three hundred rosy faces. I recalled how three hundred schoolboy's jackets, from the mayor's son's velvet coat to the flour-covered jacket of the baker's boy, told the story of the owner's status. I could still hear each different voice, could see where each child sat in school, could remember each boy's way of speaking, his manner, and the way he moved. Over time, the distinct faces merged into a pink blur, the varied jackets into a single neutral color, the unique way of going into a modest movement. Finally, all details were lost in a dense fog and my ability to visualize individuals was gone.

I am saddened by this, and I often wish I could blow away the fog and see the details once more.
