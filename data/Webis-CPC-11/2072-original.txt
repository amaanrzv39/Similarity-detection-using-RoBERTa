Dr. Brown's grandfather was Dr. Gustavus Brown who emigrated to Maryland in 1708 and in 1710
married Frances, the daughter of Colonel Gerard Fawke. Their son, Richard Brown, returned to
England to prepare himself for the church. Richard's son, William, was born in Scotland in
1748; was educated at the University of Edinburgh, graduated in 1770, and came to America.
This is Alexandria's Dr. Brown.

This young Scotsman, gentle born, learned, traveled, handsome, came to Virginia at the age
of twenty-two.
