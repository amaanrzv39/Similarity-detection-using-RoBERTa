Organs were in use in the church
at any rate in the fourth century, and were introduced into England by Archbishop Theodore.
In old times there was no official organist; the duty was taken by the master of the choristers
or one of the gentlemen of the choir. In churches of the regular foundation a monk played.

English Church music, in its proper sense, began with the Reformation. In the Roman Church,
the great genius of Palestrina had produced nothing less than a revolution as regards the ancient
Plain Song; and with the English Liturgy we associate the honoured names of Tallis, Merbecke,
Byrd, Farrant in the early days, and a splendid list of successors right down to our time,
wherein is still no falling off.
