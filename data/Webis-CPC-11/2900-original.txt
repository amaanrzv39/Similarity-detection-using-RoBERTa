My friends, ef you a'n't desput anxious to see glory
from this 'ere deck, be virtoous, an' observe the golden rule: Don't tech, don't g' nigh the
p'is'n upus-tree of gravy; beware o' the dorg called hot biscuits; take keer o' the grease,
an' the stomach'll take keer of itself. Fact is, my beloved brethren, I've ben a fust-chop
dyspeptic for the best part o' my life, an' I'm pooty wal posted in what I'm talkin' about.
What I don't know on this 'ere subjick a'n't wuth knowin'."

on the stage of action. The fated victims were to be made ready for the coming sacrifice.
