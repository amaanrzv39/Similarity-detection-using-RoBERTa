After my Constantinople excursion, I stayed in a quiet grade B hotel Brasserie Kor located on the Rue Osmanly.  I did not want to stay in an expensive hotel because it would bring attention to me.  Please would wonder who I am and do I have money.  Within any household Kim could companions and get information not available to Europeans.
