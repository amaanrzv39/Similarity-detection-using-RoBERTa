If English folly light the torch Of war in Germany
again The loss is theirs--the gain is ours March! march! commence the bright campaign.

There, only by their glorious deeds Our chiefs and gallant bands are known; There, often have
they met their foes, And victory was all their own: There, hostile ranks, at our approach,
Prostrate beneath our feet shall bow; There, smiling conquest waits to twine A laurel wreath
round every brow.

Adieu, my pretty turf-built hut * Adieu, my little garden, too!
