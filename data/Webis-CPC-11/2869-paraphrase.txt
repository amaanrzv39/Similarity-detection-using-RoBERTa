April the 26th.   Today I became an Oddfellow.  Of course I had to go through the initiation, but it didn't take long and both JERRAM and CHORKLE were being initiated with me.
Our speeches were done afterwards, which of course all included our declarations of our never ending devotion to the Oddfellowship cause.
Although many sentiments were given afterwards, one stood out more than the others, from a tailor named TABSEY.  I believe he is well known for expressing his sentiments and I will never forget the expression  on his face as he cleared his throat and in his loud clear booming voice stated "May the tear of true sympathy crystallise as it falls, and be worn as a radiant jewel upon the finger of affliction." 
What followed was what can only be descibed as voiciferous applause.
I had to pay my congratulations to TABSEY afterwards, as such a reaction had merited fair compliment.
