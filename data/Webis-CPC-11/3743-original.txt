But if you won't give up your bottle I shan't give up smoking after all.

Look, they're opening the windows. We shall all catch cold. Can you hear anything? I can hear
those people eating. What a draught! Can you hear anything? I can hear the eaters quite plainly
now. Here comes Father Christmas. I believe he is going to give us all gifts.

Can you hear anything yet? I have been given a diary. What have you got? Another diary? Is
yours for 1921? So is mine. How dull! Christmas will be on a Sunday next year, I see. So will
our wedding-day. I hope you'll remember it this time. And they have arranged for the Spring
to begin on March 21st. Think of it! Spring--in less than three months!

There they go.

  Hoot out, wild hooters, to the wild sky!

What a jolly noise! Much better than bells, really much more accurate as an expression of one's
feelings. There's a sort of "faint but pursuing" note about it. And that's how I feel, rather.
It was a dreadful year, really, wasn't it?--that last one, I mean. No money, no clothes--nothing
but rates and dentists and small accounts respectfully submitted for our esteemed favour. One
long crisis.... But we kept the flag flying. This year----

Hallo! somebody's going to recite. What do you think it will be? You'll never guess. Yes, you're
quite right.

  Ring out a slowly-dying cause
  And ancient forms of party strife.

That sounds like a bit of Government propaganda. Disgraceful, I call it. If I was a Wee Free----

  Ring in the nobler modes of life,
  With sweeter manners----

That's a hit at somebody, too, I shouldn't wonder. Somebody must have written a topical verse
for the occasion. Those people are still eating. I expect they are doing Hog-money, or whatever
it is....

Are you still as obstinate as ever about that hot-water bottle?
