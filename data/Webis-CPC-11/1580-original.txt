Started at 6.35 a.m., following the river, the general course being north-north-east; no change
was observed in its character. At 11.20 halted to rest the horses, and again started at 1.40
p.m. At 3.40 came on a large party of natives at a fresh water pool; five followed us some
miles, and were not to be satisfied until we had made an exchange of part of a handkerchief
for a quantity of noolban, some dowaks, and dabbas, some of which we accepted as a token of
our friendly intentions.
