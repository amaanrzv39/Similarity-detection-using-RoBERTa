The North
should permit nothing to stand in the way of a complete and permanent triumph. As Northern
property is all confiscated South; as Union men there are treated with the utmost barbarity;
as nothing held by the lovers of the Union is respected, the greatest injury in the end to
the Constitution and the Union is, an unwise clemency to armed rebellion. In this death-struggle
to test the vital question, whether the majority shall rule, let there be no holding back of
money or men.
