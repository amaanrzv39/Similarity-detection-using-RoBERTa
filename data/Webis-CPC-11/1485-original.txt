A large number of the
old vessels, of which it is composed, have to be laid up in any case before the end of the
year, because their crews are wanted for the enormous reinforcements of new ships which the
industry of your workships is hurrying into the water. Losses of ships, therefore, as long
as the precious lives of the officers and men are saved--which in nearly every case they have
been--losses of that kind, I say, may easily be exaggerated in the minds both of friend and
foe.
