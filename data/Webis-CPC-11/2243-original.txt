The sixty-six steam fog-signals in the waters of the United States have been established at
a cost of more than $500,000, and are maintained at a yearly expense of about $100,000. The
erection of each of these signals was authorized by Congress in an act making special appropriations
for its establishment, and Congress was in each instance moved thereto by the pressure of public
opinion, applied usually through the member of Congress representing the particular district
in which the signal was to be located.
