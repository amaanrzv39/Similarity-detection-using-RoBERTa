We thus find, from the northern coast to the centre, one supposed result
of coastal conditions, namely, social progress, but not the other supposed result of coastal
conditions, namely, the All Father belief. I do not say that it does not exist, for it is a
secret belief, but it is not reported by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen. On the other hand, among
tribes of the south-east very far from the coast, we find the lowest grades of social progress,
but we also find the All Father belief.
