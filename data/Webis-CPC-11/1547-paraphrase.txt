The figure was looking at the sky with full of angry in his eyes and with a sword in his hand. The white and colorless Deity was stooping from the sky.A falling pillar among the clouds, and a crowd with spears at the feet of the principal figure are seen on the other side of the picture. 
     This might be Joshua at the fall of Jericho.
It was painted with great vigor, and worthy of a better place.
