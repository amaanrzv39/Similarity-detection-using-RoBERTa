1861.

A very interesting letter from HENRY LAURENS, second President of the Continental Congress,
to his son, Col. JOHN LAURENS, dated Charleston, S.C., Aug. 14, 1776, now first published from
the original letter. It contains a vehement plea for Emancipation, and speaks with bitter contempt
of England for encouraging the slave-trade in America.
