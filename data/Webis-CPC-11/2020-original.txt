Porphyry was surprised and indignant because the Egyptians
sometimes dared to threaten the gods in their orations.[54] In the consecrations the priest's
summons compelled the gods to come and animate their {94} statues, and thus his voice created
divinities,[55] as originally the almighty voice of Thoth had created the world.[56]

The ritual that conferred such superhuman power[57] developed in Egypt into a state of perfection,
completeness and splendor unknown in the Occident.
