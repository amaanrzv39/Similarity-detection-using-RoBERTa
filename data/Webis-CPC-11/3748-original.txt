He had himself been surprised by one, just after dusk, on the road from Milianca,
and offered to induce the Caid of the adjoining tribe to get up a battue on our return. He
also spoke of the great number of wild boars in a way that would make a hunter's heart leap
within him. We retired to rest, and, sheltered for the nonce from the searching cold, I slept
as only a weary traveller can.

In the hope of obtaining some reliable information as to hunting prospects, I had in the Caid's
lieutenant a fine-looking fellow, rejoicing in the famous name of Abd-el-Kader, though he was
no relation to the renowned chief. He gave a long description of the capture of a boar, that
had been wounded by some Arabs; how he caught the brute by the hoofs, gagged it, and brought
it home alive. Mr. ----, he also informed us, had been surprised, about a month before, by
a lion, as he was returning at dusk from Milianah. There were many lions in the vicinity, he
added; and promised that his friend the Caid should treat us to a lion-hunt on our return,
if we came back this way.

Then we started, Abd-el-Kader accompanying us to show us a short way over the mountains to
the caravanserai of Oued-el-Massin, where we were to pass the night, and expected to find our
luggage. We were prepared to find the river very high, and our anticipations were not deceived.
Abd-el-Kader admonished me to wait on the bank while he went in to try if there was any getting
through. He returned and asked if my horse was good, and if I was willing to follow him. On
receiving my affirmative answer, he told me to fix my eyes on the opposite shore, and, above
all things, to abstain from looking at the water, which was tearing along at a tremendous rate;
if I neglected his instructions, I should infallibly be carried away and drowned.
