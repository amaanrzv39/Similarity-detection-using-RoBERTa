If a long handle is added, and it is filled with tar, it can
be used as a signal torch. If shallower baskets of the same dimensions, but with their bottoms
cut off or punched out, are placed inside these conical ones, the two together make capital
snare baskets for crabs and fish. If a bamboo stem be cut off just below the joint, and its
lower edge be split up into a cogged rim, it makes, when the partition of the joint is punched
out, an earth-auger, a fountain-pipe, and many things of the kind.
