These
rudiments are in one sense embryological, for they exist only during the youth of the leaf,
falling off and disappearing as soon as it is fully grown.

With Desmodium gyrans the two lateral leaflets are very much smaller than the corresponding
leaflets in most of the species in this large genus; they vary also in position and size; one
or both are sometimes absent; and they do not sleep like the fully-developed leaflets. They
may therefore be considered as almost rudimentary; and in accordance with the general principles
of embryology, they ought to be more constantly and fully developed on very young than on old
plants. But this is not the case, for they were quite absent on some young seedlings, and did
not appear until from 10 to 20 leaves had been formed.
