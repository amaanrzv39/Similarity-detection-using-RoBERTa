When the congregation is singing they should rise.  Singing is after all an type of worship to God.  However if the choral is spoken without music it is more of a prayer and the congregation should kneel down.  

The congregation should wait to be dismissed by the Priest.  If a Bishop is serving on the platform the Bishop is more appropriate to undertake the dismissal of the people.
