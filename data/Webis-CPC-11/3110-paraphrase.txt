The judges and the magistrate came and his majesty spoke majestically without any obstruction.Then the silver top of his staff fall down and Mr. Rushworth took it up. Suddenly I heard Bardshaw the judge  talking to the majesty.Sir wh instead of answering the court why did you question their power which is not good for your status. 
           Hearing this I was thunderstuck .How could a subordinate of his majesty dare to blame him. But to my surprise he replied with  out any pretty feelings and avoiding rashness, 
       After that his majesty was executed the parliament for some years. without any harm to the public peace of the nation .
