And as a corollary to this conventionality, how wretched men are when they are placed in false
positions! Nobody likes it, of course, but a woman can generally get out of it. Men think straighter
than women, but not so fast. I dined one night on shipboard with the captain of the transport
on which I came back from France, and there was an army chaplain at the table. So, as chaplains
frequently say grace before meat, I put a hand on the knee of a young male member of my family
beside me and kept it there, ready for a squeeze to admonish silence. But the chaplain did
not say grace, and the man on my right suddenly turned out to be a perfectly strange general
in a state of helpless uneasiness. I have a suspicion that not even the absolute impeccability
of my subsequent conduct convinced him that I was not a designing woman.

But, although we are discussing men, as all women know, there are really no men at all. There
are grown-up boys, and middle-aged boys, and elderly boys, and even sometimes very old boys.
But the essential difference is simply exterior. Your man is always a boy. He grows tidier,
and he gathers up a mass of heterogeneous information, and in the strangest possible fashion
as the years go on, boards have to be put into the dining-room table, and the shoe bill becomes
something terrible, and during some of his peregrinations he feels rather like a comet with
a tail. The dentist's bills and where to go for the summer and do-you-think-the-nurse-is-as-careful-as-she-should-be-with-baby's-bottles
make him put on a sort of surface maturity. But it never fools his womankind. Deep down he
still believes in Santa Claus, and would like to get up at dawn on the Fourth of July and throw
a firecracker through the cook's window.
