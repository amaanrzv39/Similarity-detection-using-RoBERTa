A REPLY TO THE FIRST ESSAY ON "SUPERNATURAL RELIGION" FROM DR. LIGHTFOOT." (Endnote 1:1)


The function of the critic is very important when it is properly exersized. A reviewer that examines serious work needs to receive serious and respectful consideration even though his stricture may be unpleasant for someone. It is impossible for a man to fully separate himself from his work as to judge fairyly the effects of his work. In every great work it is certain that flaws and mistakes will occur. However, every writer feels thankful to anyone who points out his errors and his mistakes. If I speak for myself, I have to say that I want nothing more than a similar frankess, and the refutation of any arguments which are thought to be fallacious. 





Even though I may be reluctant, to depart from the attitude of silent attention which should be maintained by writers when facing criticis, it is somewhat a different issue when criticism assumes the vicious tone of the Rev. Dr. Lightfoot's article upon Supernatural Religion in the December number of the "Contemporary Review."
