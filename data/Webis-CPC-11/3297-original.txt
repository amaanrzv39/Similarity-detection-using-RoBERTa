But, may the Sahela
Selasse die--these engines are the work of clever hands."

The monarch, elated with his knowledge, now determined to build a bridge, which in three days
was completed; and, as was predicted by the quiet English spectators, in three hours fell down
on the very first fresh produced by the annual rains.

Weaving excepted, the people manufactured nothing; but British commerce has long been known,
though evidently of the coarsest kind. At length, on his majesty's being told that five thousand
looms would bring him more wealth than ten thousand soldiers, he gradually consented to form
a commercial treaty. The crown had hitherto appropriated the property of strangers dying in
the country. The purchase or display of costly goods by the subject had been interdicted, and
a maxim exhibiting the whole jealousy of savage life had been established, that the stranger
who once entered was never to depart from Abyssinia. By the articles of the commercial treaty,
all those barbarous prohibitions have been abolished.

As the monarch returned the deed, he made a short speech sufficiently able and appropriate:
"You have loaded me with costly presents, the rainment that I  wear, the throne on which I
sit, the curiosities in my store-houses, and the muskets which hang round my great hall--all
are from your country. What have I to give in return for such wealth? My kingdom is as nothing."
