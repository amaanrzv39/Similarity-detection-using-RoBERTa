"I was born in Harrison County, 19 miles from Pass Christian, 'long de ridge road from de swamp
near Wolf River. My Marster was Ursan Ladnier. De Mistis' name was Popone. Us was all French.
My father was a white man, Anatole Necaise. I knowed he was my father, 'cause he used to call
me to him an' tell me I was his oldes' son.

"I never knowed my mother. I was a slave an' my mother was sol' from me an' her other chilluns.
Dey tol' me when dey sol' 'er my sister was a-holdin' me in her arms. She was standin' behin'
da Big House peekin' 'roun' de corner an' seen de las' of her mother. I seen her go, too. Dey
tell me I used to go to de gate a-huntin' for my mammy. I used to sleep wid my sister after dat.

"Jus' lemme study a little, an' I'll tell you 'bout de Big House. It was 'bout 60 feet long,
built o' hewed logs, in two parts. De floors was made o' clay dey didn' have lumber for floors
den. Us lived right close to de Big House in a cabin. To tell de truf, de fac' o' de business
is, my Marster took care o' me better'n I can take care o' myse'f now.

"When us was slaves Marster tell us what to do. He say, 'Henri, do dis, do dat.' An' us done
it. Den us didn' have to think whar de nex' meal comin' from, or de nex' pair o' shoes or pants.
De grub an' clo'es give us was better'n I ever gits now.

"Lemme think an' counts. My Marster didn' have a lot o' slaves. Dere was one, two, three, fo',
yes'm, jus' fo' o' us slaves. I was de stockholder. I tended de sheep an' cows an' such lak.
My Marster didn' raise no big crops, jus' corn an' garden stuff. He had a heap o' cattle. Dey
could run out in de big woods den, an' so could de sheeps.
