The Hun, depicted as an unsportsman-like
brute (which he is), invariably gets it in the neck (which, I regret to say, he doesn't). And
so all is for the best in the best of all possible services. In the Navy they are nothing if
not consistent and, while the military storyteller who did not have his knife into the higher
command would be looked upon as a freak, "BARTIMEUS" loyally includes amongst his galaxy of
perfect people Lords of the Admiralty no less than the lower ratings.
