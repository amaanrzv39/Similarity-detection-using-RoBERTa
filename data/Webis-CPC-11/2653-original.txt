There is such an overflowing life,
such a superb exuberance of abounding and exulting strength, in the dramatic poetry of the
half-century extending from 1590 to 1640, that all other epochs of English literature seem
as it were but half awake and half alive by comparison with this generation of giants and of
gods. There is more sap in this than in any other branch of the national bay-tree: it has an
energy in fertility which reminds us rather of the forest than the garden or the park. It is
true that the weeds and briers of the underwood are but too likely to embarrass and offend
the feet of the rangers and the gardeners who trim the level flower-plots or preserve the domestic
game of enclosed and ordered lowlands in the tamer demesnes of literature.
