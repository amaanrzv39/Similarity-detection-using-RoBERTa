The fig. 12 shows carbon packing, in which blocks of carbon are contained. These blocks are present in sets in a packing case. The packing case is bolted to the top head of the wheel-case. The packing consist of three sets of blocks. Each set is divided into three segments, having two rings. In the case the joints are broken with its mate by the ring of segments. A flange in the case separates each set from each other. The packing is set aside from turning by means of a link in some cases. In certain situations one end is fastened to the case and the other to the packing holder. The packing against the shaft is held by light springs in some cases. In certain cases, the pressure of the case does the job.  The pressure in the pipe is being reduced which is shown in the figure, leading from the main line to the packing case. By means of a three-way cock, the gap between the two upper sets of rings is drained to the third stage. The cock maintains the stability between the atmosphere and packing-case pressure. The carbon rings are built-in to the shaft started with a slight clearance. A smooth finish is obtained rapidly which is practically both steam-light and frictionless.
The carbon ring drawn in traditional design is shown in Fig. 12. Spiral springs set in brass ferrules aid the segments to hold in opposition to the flat bearing surface of the case. The circle is held jointly by a bronze strap. This strap is screwed and drawn mutually at the ends by springs. Whereas other springs press the straps against the surface. This surface bears the carbon which cuts off leaks through joints and across horizontal surfaces of the carbon. A connecting-rod prevents the whole ring from turning by which a pin is engaged in the hole. These holes are similar to those which are provided by the strings.
