How many times has the world's greatest voices been discovered by accident!

In America there are many lovely voices and thinking about how many people with successful opera careers in this country and in others it can't be honestly said that America doesn't produce opera singers.A lot of these whom I have heard are from New York and are Americans and their great voices give an idea of what a great opera singer is.

It would be kind of funny sometimes if it wasn't sad, too, that there are people who mistakenly think they have a future in singing. Not long ago a young man came to sing for me and he carried a hugh roll of music.He had a very deep bass voice when he spoke.When I inquired about his biggest problem he had singing with which he answered"I can't seem to get on key." This was proven when he started to sing and went up and down the scale until he managed to hit it right.I was asked for my choice between two songs for him to sing which were "Qui sdegno," or"Magic Flute" by Mozart or "love Me and the World is Mine." I chose the latter song. He asked the accompanist to transpose it  and upon the man's sugessting a thrird lower he requested it to be put down an octive.This is where he sang it. After he was done I gently but firmly suggessted he find another job instead of music.
