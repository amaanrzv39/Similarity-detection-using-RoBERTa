Even though he failed to take hold of large things, according to the nourished suggestions of great scientific researchers like Humboldt, Darwin, and Alfred Russell Wallace, he was very much interested, well informed, hard-working and understanding on their suggestions. Even though he was a well trained anthropologist and he was capable to research on personal relations with the Tasmanian blacks, his valuable writings was merited with great value and they were quite interesting to read.  Tasmanian blacks were belonging to a traditional race and now they had become died due to the negative contact of European civilization. In his whole writing, in nearly two pages, he was narrating about personâ€™s first meeting with the aboriginals - especially when they had been longing for pure water to drink and the amazement of the savages like an incident with delightful humor etc., during their encounter by white people. But at the same time, they were showing very close relationship and careful observation also.  It was highly appreciable and welcomed by the reader.
