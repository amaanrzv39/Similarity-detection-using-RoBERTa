I do not care that I lost that small unimportant paper, because it was written by people I do not know, professors and politicians without proper knowledge. It would not have even been read in libraries and other archives across the Swiss republics. I will write in French for the whole of Europe because it is my habit to do so. I understand, however, that my style, which fits somewhere between prose and poetry, has become a horrible wordy, bloated document.
