The Pope
granted indulgences to all who carried on this pious work.

In 1184, Pope Lucius III, in union with the Emperor Frederic Barbarossa, adopted at Verona

secular arm, which was to inflict upon them the punishment they deserved (animadversio debita).[1]
The Emperor decreed the imperial ban against them.
