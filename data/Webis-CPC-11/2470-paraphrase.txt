Please do not be so harsh. Be forgiving of Miss Swallow, as she is a close relative of mine and is under quite a bit of pressure as a woman who is not as young as she wishes she were. 

Lady Sneer still maintains her appearence. 

Mrs. Can retains her grace despite having very little education. 

Sir Ben and Sir Pet are both very good natured, almost disgustingly so!
