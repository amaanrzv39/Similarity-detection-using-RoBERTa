In almost every case, the flat E note is not held for any longer duration than a forte made with a careless stroke of the bow would endure upon the strings. Consider if Beethoven's voice was heard from the grave telling a conductor. "Hold my fermata, firmly, terribly! I did not produce the fermatas as a joke or because I did not know how I wanted to proceed; I indulge in the fullest, the most kept tone to express myself Adagio, and I utilize the firm and complete tone when I desire to have it in an Allegro full of passion as an intense spasm. The the tone should have its blood released to the very last drop. I hold down the seas waves, and the depths shall be seen; or, I stem the clouds, dissolve the mist and show a pure blue spirit, and the amazing core of the sun.
