The United States government tug Potomac, while on her way to Fort de France with supplies
from San Juan, Porto Rico, overhauled a small boat containing five negroes and a white man.
Something in the appearance of the men excited the suspicions of the commander of the Potomac,
Lieutenant McCormick, and he ordered them to come on board. When they were searched, their
pockets were found to be filled with coin and jewelry. Rings in their possession had evidently
been stripped from the fingers of the dead. Lieutenant McCormick placed them all under arrest,
and later turned them over to the commander of the French cruiser Suchet for punishment.

Thus it was that no detail of grewsome horror was lacking to make the shocking tale of the
destruction of St. Pierre complete.
