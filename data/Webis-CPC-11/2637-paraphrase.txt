Greater clapping of hands when a Hon. Gentleman picked  up a Cornet and played a solo. Enthusiastic. 

Mr. Farmer-Atkinson  (bowing before them after recovering from his exertions).expressed Hear, hear!  Ladies and Gentlemen. Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen, for your warmer reception.(Applause.) you must have known that although I have given you a solo on the cornet,I did not visit this luxuriant town, a highly civilised town ((audience cheered) a model town (audience clapped with praise) with the intention of blowing my own trumpet.He stopped it for a moment and then spoke Don't you understand? I did not want to blow my own trumpet--joke, see? There was a laughter.Thank you! And now  the Irish Question is! Well everybody harps upon it. So will I. "Come back to Erin."
