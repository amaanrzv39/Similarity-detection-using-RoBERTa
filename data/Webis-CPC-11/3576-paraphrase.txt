Afterwards, Mrs. Sheen showed General Dalton's house to her friend who was wanting to buy a home after returning from living abroad. 

While viewing the house, Mrs. Sheen and her friend browsed through the first two floors, and everything seemed to be going well; so, Mrs. Sheen lead her friend to the third floor. When Mrs. Sheen reached the top of the steps, she heard her friend yell, "I can't go farther. Something is pushing me back." 

Mrs. Sheen quickly ran down the stairs. Was her friend sick? When Mrs. Sheen got to the first floor her friend said, "A force pushed me back. I'm psychic and I know that the ghost who lives here would make it impossible for me to live here. I'd love to own this house, but the ghost will not allow me to live here."
