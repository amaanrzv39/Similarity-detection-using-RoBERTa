That is taken care of by nature. I challenge thee to stroll on any given of the London streets and behold with your sight a whale and six porpoises! This very morning that is what I beheld. But surely you will argue that I cannot see either a fire engine nor a vehicle, but alas to you, I can respond that yes already I have seen them. How do you propose to get out of that corner, unless you say that bergs, whales, and old porpoises you have no interest in seeing?  -the confusion of facts will be forbidden by your "Scotch" conscience.
