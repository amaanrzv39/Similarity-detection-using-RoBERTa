M. Flaubert has taken the part of the extreme sacrament from the book which a revered priest, one of his mate, gave him; this same friend has read the part and moved to tears, not thinking that the majesty of religion was in any way insulted. The book is named: An historic, assertive, moral, conventional and legal explanation of the questioning, with an answer to the doubts extracted from science against religion, by the Abbe Ambriose Guillois, caretaker of Notre-Dame-du-Pre, 6th edition, etc., a chore accepted by His Eminence the Cardinal Gousset, N.N.S.S. the Bishops and Archbishops of Mans, of tours, of Bordeaux, of Cologne,etc., vol. iii., printed at Mans, by Charles Monnoyer. 1851.
