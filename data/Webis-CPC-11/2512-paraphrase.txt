She had correspondence with a talented, inventive and brilliant force.  She ordered from a Paris book company, for copies of books written by Balzac. She used to read his booksrepeatedly and found that all the words written in his books were in such a manner, as if, they were written only for her.  She always took small notes and wrote opinions on his writing and sent them to Balzac

But Balzac avoided her papers and did not accept them.  So she pleaded him to have a seperate column for himself in a certain Paris paper, for  which she was subscribing periodically,  so that she would be aware of his well being at any time.  

Atlast, he agreed to her peculiar request.  It appeared , as if, they were very much familiar with each other.  The happiness was not at its full, with respect to that lady.  It was only a secret contact with a gentle and moderate man, which was a pleasing sin  under the cover of a pleasant and sacred smell.
