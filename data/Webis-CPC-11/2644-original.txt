This horse, which she called JACK, had lost not merely the ornaments of mane and tail, but
his head, one fore and one hind leg; so that nothing remained of the once noble quadruped but
a barrel with the paint scratched off, rather insecurely perched upon a stand with wheels.
But he was a faithful animal, and did his work to the last. The baby used to tie me on to his
barrel, and Jack and I were drawn round and round the kitchen with as much satisfaction to
our mistress, as in the days when I shone forth, in my gilt coach with its four prancing piebalds.

But the baby's treatment of me, though gratifying from its cordiality, had a roughness and
want of ceremony that affected my enfeebled frame.
