Vicar of Rochdale (Vol. vii., p. 380), Reverend Richard Midgley. –Dr. Whitaker refers to Samuel Clarke's Lives of Thirty-two English Divines, the collection of the lives of pious persons, as one which contains a highly fascinating description of Midgley. You can find this extremely pleasing passage at page 68 of the life of “Master Richard Rothwell" (Clarkes's Lives, edit. 1677, fol.), and the one I feel most justified in extracting.
