Briefly she looked out of the window into the dark night.My poor heart was shaken with delight, and I strained my eyes looking into the blank darkness that loomed large.Daylight brought the chores of the day into focus and the reality of routine reduced the shaky feelings of the previous night.With rewened commitment I pursued my work and totally immersed myself in it.I spent more time working with the youngesters and also decided to prepare a composition for the next day knowing fully well that it would require a great deal of concentration and many hours of hard work. I built a protective armor around myself but the evening again brought a feeling of void that left me distraught.Mr Fairman was not at home. Idid not feel comfortable there and decided to go down to the village.I did not want to upset myself too much and avoided  visiting the distant house.I had very few friends and contacts in the village but there were some special friends of the incumbent's daughter.I made my way to one of these favourites simply to pass time that hung on me painfully at home.For some time I discussed general topics with the elderly female of the house; then a chance observation with reference to Miss Ellen escaped my lips. The village took up the theme at length.
