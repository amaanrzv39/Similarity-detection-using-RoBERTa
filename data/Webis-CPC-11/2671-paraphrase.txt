Many provisions outlined in the Irish Parliments Bill 1893 are currently being rewritten and resubmitted in the form of Bill 1886 as soon as they can be gleaned from certain Ministers speech notes. As a matter of fact, the minor differences preclude additional documentation, basing discussions solely on Bill 1893, recently passed by the House of Commons.  The Bill must be favorable in both houses, but if this does not turn out to be the case, the Legislative Assembly version, after a two year stall, will be debated in a Joint Session of the two Houses.
