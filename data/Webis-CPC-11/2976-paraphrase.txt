The wise among us know of the strategies employed by Pope soon after, in an attempt to attain a broader and more illustrious reputation than any other English Poet had in life. Those who know this also know that the poor application of those efforts is the reason that Pope has long since dropped to such a low level of influence in the literary canon, such that he would never have suffered had he not been overly interested in popularity and instant gratification. Had Pope placed more confidence in his natural ability, he would never have lost so much respect.

Pope mesmerized the country with his musical cadence, and enthralled it by his careful polish, and in so doing blinded himself with illusions of grandeur.
