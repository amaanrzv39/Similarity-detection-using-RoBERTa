From the days of slavery Negroes have tried the fortunes of the marketplace & under freedom their enterprises have increased in number & variety. At the present time Southern-born & West Indian Negroes form the bulk of the business men, the latter far in excess of their proportion in the Negro population. This success of West Indians is partly a result of training & initiative developed in a more favorable environment, as they had the benefit of whatever opportunities their West Indian surroundings offered.
