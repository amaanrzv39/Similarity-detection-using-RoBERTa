As an effect there will be a decent path force force lines through the core's iron and very minute change in the amount of lines passing the the armature winding. However, as the armature flange's corners move from the pole piece's corners there is a sudden conditional change. This change is best demonstrated by referring to the right hand position of Fig. 71. The force lines lie perpendicularly to the center portion of the armature core and could no longer find a pathway to it.
