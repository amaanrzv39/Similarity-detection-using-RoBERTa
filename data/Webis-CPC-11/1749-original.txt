It is too much, as Delehaye ("Legendes Hagiographiques")
remarks, to expect the populace to distinguish between namesakes.  Great men are so rare! 
Is it likely there should have lived two saints of the same name in the same country!

The latest commentators on the question of St. Declan's period--and they happen to be amongst
the most weighty--argue strongly in favour of the pre-Patrician mission (Cfr. Prof. Kuno Meyer,
"Learning Ireland in the Fifth Century").
