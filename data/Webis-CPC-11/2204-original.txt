Both monopoly and speculation sent recruits into the sea-dog ranks. Elizabeth
would grant, say, to Sir Walter Raleigh, the monopoly of sweet wines. Raleigh would naturally
want as much sweet wine imported as England could be induced to swallow. So, too, would Elizabeth,
who got the duty. Crews would be wanted for the monopolistic ships. They would also be wanted
for 'free-trading' vessels, that is, for the ships of the smugglers who underbid, undersold,
and tried to overreach the monopolist, who represented law, though not quite justice.
