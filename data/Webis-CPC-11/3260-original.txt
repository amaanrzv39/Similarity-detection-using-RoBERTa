And
they make it easily understood how those missionaries failed who attempted to persuade them
that all this boasted power was false. More correct views than these ought to have been suggested
by the facts themselves, for it is indisputable that these magicians did not hesitate at times
to test their strength on each other. In these strange duels Ã  l'outrance, one would be seated
opposite his antagonist, surrounded with the mysterious emblems of his craft, and call upon
his gods one after another to strike his enemy dead. Sometimes one, "gathering his medicine,"
as it was termed, feeling within himself that hidden force of will which makes itself acknowledged
even without words, would rise in his might, and in a loud and severe voice command his opponent
to die! Straightway the latter would drop dead, or yielding in craven fear to a superior volition,
forsake the implements of his art, and with an awful terror at his heart, creep to his lodge,
refuse all nourishment, and presently perish. Still more terrible was the tyranny they exerted
on the superstitious minds of the masses. Let an Indian once be possessed of the idea that
he is bewitched, and he will probably reject all food, and sink under the phantoms of his own
fancy.

How deep the superstitious veneration of these men has struck its roots in the soul of the
Indian, it is difficult for civilized minds to conceive. Their power is currently supposed
to be without any bounds, "extending to the raising of the dead and the control of all laws
of nature."[277-1] The grave offers no escape from their omnipotent arms.
