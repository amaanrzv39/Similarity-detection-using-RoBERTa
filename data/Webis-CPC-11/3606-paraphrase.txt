I was successful in my treatment of similar sufferings, for which I had discovered an anodyne that was specific. I wrote on a leaf of my pocketbook a prescription which I felt sure would be efficacious, and as I tore it out and placed it in his hand, I chanced to look up, and saw the hazel eyes of my hostess fixed on me with a kinder and softer expression than they often condescended to admit in to their chilled and penetrating lustre. At that moment, however, her attention was drawn from me to a servant, who entered with a note, and I heard him say, though in an undertone, "From Mrs. Ashleigh."

He opened the note, read it hastily, ordered the servant to wait without the door, retired to her writing-table, which stood near the place at which I still lingered, rested her face on her hand, and seemed musing. Her meditation was soon over. He turned her head, and to my surprise, beckoned to me. I approached.

He placed in my hand the note he had received. It contained but a few words, to this effect:--

"Sit here," he whispered: "turn your back towards those people, who are no doubt watching us. Read this."
