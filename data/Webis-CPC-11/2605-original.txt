The unparalleled increase
of population in the first three quarters of the 19th century has been followed by a progressive
decrease in the birth-rate, which will begin to tell upon social conditions when the reduction
in the death-rate, which has hitherto kept pace with it, shall have reached its natural limit.
Europe with a stationary population will be in a much happier condition; and problems of social
reform can then be tackled with some hope of success. Honourable emulation in the arts of life
may then take the place of desperate competition and antagonism. Human lives will begin to
have a positive value, and we may even think it fair to honour our saviours more than our destroyers.
