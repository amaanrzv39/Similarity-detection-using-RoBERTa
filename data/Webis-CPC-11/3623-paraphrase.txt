(not as good a game) that I want to discuss, but about something that happened later.

The night was quite damp, and when it was time for us to leave, it wasn't clear whether we'd be able to get a taxi that would be agreeable to taking us home.

"I'll ask the porter," Willoughby said (the Hicksons live in an apartment), and off he went, coming back shortly with a secretive look.

"Put on your coat," he said tersely.

"Did you find a taxi?"

"No, but I got hold of a car. Put on your coat, and let's go."

"A car?" I answered. "What do you mean? Where did you get a car?"

Willoughby whipped around. "You can walk if you'd rather," he said; "if you want a ride, just put your coat on and stop asking questions."

I didn't want to walk--if only I had done so!--but went ahead and wished the hosts a good night.  While I was doing that, the porter showed up.

"Quickly, sir", he whispered loudly to Willoughby. "He's in a hurry and can't wait."

We followed along behind the porter, who continued to whisper to Willoughby.

"He's my pal, always helping me out.  He's going right to your area."  He bobbed his head up and down with confidence.

Willoughby looked my way.  "Do you have half a crown?" he asked.

I did. The porter bobbed his head all the more.

When we got to the door, we found a magnificent automobile, replete with a typically inscrutable chauffeur.

"I really appreciate--", Willoughby started to say.

"Oh, that's OK, sir," the man said. "I'm headed in that direction."

We got in, pulled the blanket across our laps, and off went the car.

"Great ride," said Willoughby.

"I take it that the driver knows the porter?" I said.

"True."

"And the car belongs to?"

"Don't know."

"Well, ignorance is bliss."
