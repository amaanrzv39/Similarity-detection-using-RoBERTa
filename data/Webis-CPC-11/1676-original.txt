The next I give you is an extract from the Court Rolls of the Borough of Hales Owen, of the

Custom of Bride Ale.

"A payne ys made that no person or persons that shall brewe any weddyn ale to sell, shall not
brewe aboue twelve stryke of mault at the most, and that the said persons so marryed shall
not keep nor haue above eyght messe of persons at hys dinner within the burrowe, and before
hys brydall daye he shall keep no unlawfull games in hys house nor out of hys house on payne
of 20s."
