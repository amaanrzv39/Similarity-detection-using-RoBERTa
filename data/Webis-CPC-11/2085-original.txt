This young gentleman's (save the mark!) name is Lord William F. Beauvoir, the latest
scion of a venerable and wealthy English family. We print the full name of this beautiful exemplar
of "haughty Albion," although he first appeared among our citizens under the alias of Beaver,
by which name he is now generally known, although recorded on the books of the Astor House
by the name which our enterprise first gives to the public. Lord Beauvoir's career since his
arrival here has been one of unexampled extravagance and mad immorality.
