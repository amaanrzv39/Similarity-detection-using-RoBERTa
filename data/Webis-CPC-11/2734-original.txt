And even granting that Sir William Follett had a tendency
towards the former failing, it was surely exhibited under circumstances which warrant us in
saying, that "even his failings leaned to virtue's side."

Connected with and immediately dependent upon this imputation upon the late Sir William Follett,
is another which cannot be overlooked. He is charged with having made a profit of his prodigious
popularity and reputation, by discreditably and unconscientiously receiving fees from clients
for services which he well knew at the time that he could not possibly render to them; in short,
with taking briefs in cases to which he had no reasonable hope of being able to attend. This
is a very grave accusation, and requires a deliberate and honest examination.
