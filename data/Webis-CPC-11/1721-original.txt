Incised wounds, especially in inflamed tissues, tend to bleed profusely; and when a vessel
is only partly divided and is therefore unable to contract, it continues to bleed longer than
when completely cut across.

The special risks of incised wounds are: (1) division of large blood vessels, leading to profuse
h√¶morrhage; (2) division of nerve-trunks, resulting in motor and sensory disturbances; and
(3) division of tendons or muscles, interfering with movement.
