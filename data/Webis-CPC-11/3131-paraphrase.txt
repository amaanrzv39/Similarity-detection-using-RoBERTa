The flowers on the slopes above Prato are wonderful, and the village is full of good songs to shoot, but the best, in my imagination, it is the church, and how it is, and covered porch, where introduced. This site is trivial from the outside, but it took me two sketches of him out.
There is also a cool, semi-finished, St. George and the Dragon, probably of the fifteenth century, and not without feeling. There are not many in the church, which modernized and more recent than the tower. The tower is very good, and secondly, whether other hand, the higher the fifth, but not nearly so well positioned Levantine.

People are so happy Primadengo Prato of cherries, but he saw no people under the trees.
