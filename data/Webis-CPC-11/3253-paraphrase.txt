RECOGNISING.

Usual form of confirmation (and very graceful, it is) is done as follows: - On being hit, spring out, body and feet together with heels, bring your sword while to recover, or sword in an upright position the face, thumb in line with your mouth, and knuckles outwards.

Confirmation should be only a matter of seconds, and when the player was supposed to come back to the Guard and commitment to continue fighting.

Fault hits.

Certainly there are occasions where the best player can not help make a foul hit. When this happens there is nothing to do but apologize, but most of these hits can be avoided with a little care and control of temper. A mistake is meant to hit your opponent dealt a blow that has a shot at him - gave a positive result, not as an attempt to "time", but instead of a guardian and, as a matter in fact, very often given the blow "for" blow principle.

This course is a great nonsense, assume, as should you, that weapons are clear when such exchanges would be a bit more severe punishment than even avid veriest would take care of.

If you only want to see who can stand the hammering, with an ash-plant, then your pads are a mistake and a waste of time. Ten minutes, but will do more to address this question than an hour with them.
