If a young poet's nausea at the sight of a toothbrush is significant of anything at all except
bad upbringing, then it is capable of being refined into a vision of life and of being expressed
by means of the appropriate mechanism or myth. But to register the mere facts of consciousness,
undigested by the being, without assessment or reinforcement by the mind is, for all the connection
it has with poetry, no better than to copy down the numbers of one's bus-tickets.
