My plan was this, I shot three and hung them up, like thieves,to scare all that came to the corn; and from this time, as long as the dead ones hung there,not a bird came near. When the corn was ripe, I made a cut down out of the swords from the ship, and got in my crop.

Few of us think of the coast at which a loaf of bread is made.When I had got the corn home,I had to thrash it,part the grain from the tease, and store it up. Then came the want of a mill to grind it, of sieves to clean it, and of ferment to make bread of it.

Still, my bread was made, though I had no tools; and no one could say that I did not earn it, by the sweat of my forehead.

The next thing to be made was a sieve, to part the grain from the husks
