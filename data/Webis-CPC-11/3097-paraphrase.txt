Peter Bayssiere Confesses His Conversion to His Children [4]

[Note:  The following story was called "I wish to tell my children of my conversion to Protestantism, by Peter Bayssiere, city of Montaigut, France.  According to the London edition, this letter is only as good as the corroborating letter from Rev. Francis Cunningham, dated may 20, 1829, which will verify its contents.

I saw Bayssiere's signature on the letter when I visited France in 1826.
