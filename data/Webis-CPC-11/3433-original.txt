At four o'clock, satisfied that no useful purpose could be effected by going farther
up the stream, we stopped at a collection of huts called Las Sandias,--not inappropriately,
for the whole sloping bank of the river, which here appeared to be little better than a barren
sand-bed, was covered, for a quarter of a mile, with a luxuriant crop of water- and musk-melons,
now in their perfection. We purchased as many as we could carry off for a real. They were full,
rich, and juicy, and proved to be a grateful restorative, after our day's exposure to the direct
rays of the sun, and their scarcely less supportable reflection from the water. The melon-patch
of Las Sandias is overflowed daring the rainy season, and probably the apparently bare, sandy
surface hides rich deposits of soil below.

We found the stream here alive with an active and apparently voracious fish, varying in length
from fourteen to twenty inches, reddish in color, and closely resembling the Snapper of the
Atlantic coast of Central America. The male inhabitants of Las Sandias were occupied in catching
these fishes with hand-nets, in the rifts and currents; and the women were busy in cleaning
and drying them. Their offal had accumulated around the huts in offensive heaps, and gave out
an odor which was almost insupportable, but of which the women appeared to take no notice.
We did not, therefore, trespass long on their hospitality, but returned to our boat and started
back to La Union.
