The population migration into Italy can be attributed to the end of the supplies of grain caused by the implementation of emphyteusis. The strain on the food supply quickly amounted to the servile wars. This was during the most corrupt period of Roman history, which in turn led to the establishment of the Empire.

Emphyteusis, a system similar to serfdom, was in place until nearly five hundred years later under Roman Code. The Western Empire had fallen to the Northern arms and the emperor Zenos changed the emphyteusis operation. Tracts of land were in essence rent-stabilized, and tenants were given more power over the land itself. In Portugal, the Visigoths ousted the Romans and removed the system of emphyteusis from the land.
