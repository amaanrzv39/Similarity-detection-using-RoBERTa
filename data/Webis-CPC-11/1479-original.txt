Stilling has related how Goethe made him aware of his presence. A message came to
him that a stranger, who had been taken ill at an inn, wished to see him. He found the stranger
in bed with head covered, and when at his request he leant over to feel his pulse, the patient
flung his arms round his neck. On the evening of the same day there was a social gathering
at the house of a pious merchant in the town in honour of Lavater, who had come to Elberfeld
and was the merchant's guest.
