I have a wish of a pure river, shape of birch canoe,
bearing the brave arrow and bow,from the war.the flooting flags and streams along the great monsters of the deep. making the water sweep and making the green field golden . The fans in the grain field rotate.Here comes the colombus with a plumbed pines to spread their shadows to spread his sails.
