He was given a lavish funeral in his home town-Declan's High Place-just as the angel showed him, just as the angel had shown him many miraculous things.  He left this earthly realm, bound for Heaven to be with the Father, Son and Holy Spirit for eternity. Amen. The End.

This man, Michael O'Clery patterned his life after Declan in Cashel, a character in the book of Eochy O'Herrerman written in 1582.  An emulation carried out to its end in the Convent of the Friars at Druiske on February 27, 1629.
