The gum in the powder is melted and the pattern is fastened to the material in this process.  To fix the pattern the iron should be extremely hot but it should not scorch the cloth.  If the color of the material is changed by the heat, the material has to be ironed all over.  Try to avoid any stamping by this process on a hot or damp day.  The powder should be kept in a cool and dry place. The most suitable way to fix the pattern while using light-colored powder, is to hold the reverse of the cloth opposite the stovepipe or the base of the iron.
