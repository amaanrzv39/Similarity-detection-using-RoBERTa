Since the American cities were unprepared to do certain things at school level like France, Germany, Italy and England who all had already admitted the necessity to give more amenities and facilities to the school children, their arguments were even more strengthened. The experience showed that American cities will have to follow the example of the European counries. Therefore, why should we not start immediately and give school meals, school eyeglasses etc. The Committee which was set up on Physical Welfare of School Children was of the view that with so little information available to them, it would not be feasible to head start the project. In addition to this, there was necessity of the large sums of money required to meet the expenses in this regard.So the project must be started only with full preparedness so that it meets the desired results.
