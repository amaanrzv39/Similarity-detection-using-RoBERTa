As another exception to the above reasoning, I should not feel confident in venturing
on a journey in a foreign country without a companion. I should want at intervals to hear the
sound of my own language. There is an involuntary antipathy in the mind of an Englishman to
foreign manners and notions that requires the assistance of social sympathy to carry it off.
As the distance from home increases, this relief, which was at first a luxury, becomes a passion
and an appetite.
