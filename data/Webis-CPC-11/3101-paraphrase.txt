Next week takes us to Bibury and Stockbridge. and if this hot weather continues, the motto of the Club should be, "Dum vivo Bibere"--or, freely translated--"Half the soda, !" The race to which I propose to give my attention is the Alington Plate, and as I am nothing if not thorough, you will see that my tip is influenced by my being at the Seaside?

Which remarkable prediction was fully borne out by the race, in fact, so close a description might have been written after the race--a great compliment to my powers of divination!

Yours devotedly, LADY GAY.

ALINGTON PLATE SELECTION.

The storm was raging through the night, I tossed on my pillow, And pitied any luckless wight Who tossed on the "Billow!"
