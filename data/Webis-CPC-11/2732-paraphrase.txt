The town governor showed up after spending time in the market place, and led the group the aging Moslem woman's home, in which they would stay the night. Major Harris observes that the three daughters names were deserving of Fair Star and Prince Cherry. Their names were Sunbeam, Eve, and Sweet Limes. The women filled the home with a wonderful sense of humor, although it was scant, deplorably dirty, and had no food or beds of any kind. The unlucky group had to then spend a night in the wide open field, surely not equal to their miseries. They intensely suffered the cold,due to being so close to the equator, and the turbulent rains came, draining down inside the roof, and the doorway.
