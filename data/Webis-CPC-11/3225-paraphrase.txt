George III:

The king was fond of a certain wine-merchant by the name of Mr. Carbonel. His majesty admitted the merchant to royal hunts quite often. One day, after such a hunt, King George the Third talked with Mr. Carbonel in a most friendly and polite manner. As they rode for awhile, Mr. Carbonel apologized for his behavior, to which the king replied with a hearty laugh.

The Duke of Wellington:

On the morning of the battle of Salamanca, the duke's personal secretary visited while the duke was lying on a small military cot. The aide apologized for the accomodations, "Your grace has not even the room to turn." The duke promptly replied, "I have seen much during my many years. You'll soon learn that when a general is going to move in his bed, the only direction to move is out."
