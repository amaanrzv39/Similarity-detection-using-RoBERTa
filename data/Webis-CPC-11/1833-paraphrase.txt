Because you have helped me so much, and you mean a lot to me, I feel your purpose is to help others also. This time, it is possible that God is using it to bring you and Him closer, to show you a new resource of strength, and to revise your values.

We don't know how, but their wills are the same as ours, our wills are our own, to make them thine.

You literally must abide by his will, and not your own. Unless you completely sacrifice it, neither you or Him will be happy, and I strongly believe in you.
