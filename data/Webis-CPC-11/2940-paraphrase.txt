The ship buzzes with activity, and guns on deck are hastily housed. Bridges are housed also, and sailors dive through the deck holes. The commander follows. Water begins to seep in to the ballast tanks while the crew seal every opening. Down goes the U-47-1/2 until only her periscope shows, a periscope painted camouflage. The eyes of the watch-officer are glued to the periscope.

"She is a Dutchman, sir," he says. The commander steps to the periscope and takes a look. The Dutchman has no wireless. It is not wise to sink every Dutch boat one meets--although German submarines have sunk a sufficient number of them, in all conscience.
