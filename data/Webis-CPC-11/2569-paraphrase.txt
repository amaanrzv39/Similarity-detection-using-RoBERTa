There are much difference between the cases arising under the Constitution and also the cases arising under the laws of the United States. The restrictions put on the authority of the State legislature gives examples to understand it better. For example, they are not to give paper money. This is according to the Constitution and has no connection at all to any of the law of the United States. However, if paper money is emited, then the controversies regarding it will come under the case of the Constitution and not the laws of the United States. Also, the word "equity" has brought about many questions.
