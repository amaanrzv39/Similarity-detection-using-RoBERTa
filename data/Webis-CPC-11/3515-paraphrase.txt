The wording was carried out forthwith, and the other priests, his companions, were to lay him down to rest where he fell. 
At Pin, some Uhlans encountered two young boys on the street. They tied them by the arms to their horses and galloped off. The bodies of the poor lads were found a few miles away--their knees were "literally crushed"; one had his throat slit and both had numerous bullets in their heads. At Sermaize, a labourer, named Brocard, and his son, were arrested. His wife and daughter-in-law, mad with terror, threw themselves into a neighbouring stream. The old man broke away, and ran to try and save them. The Germans dragged him away.... Four days later Brocard and the son, on being liberated, returned to his house, and after a search, found the bodies. The two women, while still in the water, had been shot several times through the head. A parish priest named Dergent was taken to Aerschot, stripped, and tied to a cross in front of the church; his fingers and toes were crushed and broken with the butt-end of a rifle. The residents were made to pass in front of him and were each compelled to urinate on him in turn; then he was shot and his body thrown into the canal.[10] 
At Hériménil, during the pillage, the inhabitants were locked up in a church, and kept there for four days without food. When Madame Winger, 23 years of age, and her three young servants, one girl and two boys, were too slow in leaving her farm to go to the church, the captain ordered his men to fire on them.
