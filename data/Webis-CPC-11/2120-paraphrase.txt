I had been surprised at former that Anthony,  whom knew so well the threats and mysteries of the East, advocated Miss Gilder  towards meddle within so delicate an affair; and there had never been any definitions between us. But I told myself that his motive was sympathy with Monny's yearn towards help: or else he had been tempted  towards guy himself with her within an adventure  whereas again, as once or twice ahead of, he had been able  towards victory her gratitude. Perhaps both motives combined.

As for Mrs. East, she frankly sulked.
