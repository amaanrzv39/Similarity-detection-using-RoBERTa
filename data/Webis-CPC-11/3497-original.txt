Cannot something be done to save our fish in Connecticut River? There is an establishment at
Holyoke, Mass., and another at Windsor Locks, Conn., that are manufacturing logs into paper,
and I am told that the chemicals used for that purpose are let off into the river twice a day,
and that the fish for half a mile come up as though they had been cockled.

Both of these factories are at the foot of falls where the fish collect and stop in great numbers
and are all killed. Our shores and sand-bars are literally lined with dead fish. Three salmon
have been found among them within two miles of my office. They were judged to weigh 12, 20
and 25 pounds. The dead fish are so numerous that eagles are here after them. I have received
nine that have been shot here in the past two seasons.

I have written you in order that the fish commissioners might stop this nuisance and save the
fish that they have taken so much pains to propagate.

Truly yours,

Wm Hood, East Windsor Hill, Conn., October 13, 1879

SAINT STEPHEN, March 1, 1880.

Prof. SPENCER F. BAIRD U. S. Commissioner Fish and Fisheries:

Dear Sir: I send you remarks in relation to the Restigouche and Saint Croix Rivers, which,
though crude, I am sure are quite correct, as they are either taken from the official statistics,
or are facts of which I am myself cognizant. You may, if of use, publish any part of them.

I very much wish we could procure some young shad for the Saint Croix; this fish was once very
abundant, and perhaps would be again if introduced. I know you have been very successful in
restocking the Connecticut. Our old people deplore the loss of the shad--say it was a much
better food-fish than the salmon.
