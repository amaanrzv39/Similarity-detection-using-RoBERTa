In the dramatic poetry written in England during the period encompassing 1590-1640, there is an explosion of life, a mammonth enthusiasm of abundant and triumphant strength. The titans and gods of this era, trump all other works of English literature, making them seem boring and trite in comparison. This era's literature is sappier than any other limb of the bay-tree. It is like the denseness of the forest compared with the formal garden or a park. It is obvious that the weedy undergrowth and thorns are overwhelming to the gardeners and park rangers who tend to the domestic animals and the potted plants in the formal gardens and private reserves in the tamer realms of literature.
