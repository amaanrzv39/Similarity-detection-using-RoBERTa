On the 9th of June a fire occured. The town's houses were built primarily of wood and gave fuel to the fire that raged out of control, beyond the towns ability to contain it. The Custom-house, Roman Catholic Church, Protestant Episcopal Cathedral, Court-house, jail, ordnance store, all the newspaper and printing-offices, the banks, the Hall of Legislature, post-office, and police-office, perished along with two whole streets, each more than a mile in length. 12, 000 people became homeless as a result.
