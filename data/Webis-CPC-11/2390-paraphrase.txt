I was amazed to see that in one day my notes got reduced to 3/4 inch, normally I don't take delibrate
views on it.Later,I changed the way of observing barometer.Earlier i buse to watch it all day long and at night for every change but now at my astonishment I see how slow it is,it holding most
between the nine ans twentieth and thirtieth inch of late.
