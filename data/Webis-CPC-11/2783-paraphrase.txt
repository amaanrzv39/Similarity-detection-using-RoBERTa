At the moment the war broke out he had tossed out his sponge. By the end of the month of August, a ship docked at the Eastern port, for the volunteers of the Western Front. The port gave a very high number of volunteers, but one berth remained unoccupied. The patient Consul had one moment of Genius. He had the chance and the tools that he needed to increase man-power for his region. He also got rid of the useless people. His men, who searched quite a distance found John Fanshawe behind a Malay go-down, unaware of everything. They took him onto the ship.

This is how the hero answered his call.

He appeared on our squadron and was assigned to my division.
