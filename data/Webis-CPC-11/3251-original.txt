Theirs is a wrong opinion who think all mouths profit a country that consume its produce, and
it may be more truly affirmed, that he who does not some way serve the commonwealth, either
by being employed or by employing others, is not only a useless, but a hurtful member to it.

As it is charity, and what we indeed owe to human kind, to make provision for the aged, the
lame, the sick, blind, and impotent, so it is a justice we owe to the commonwealth not to suffer
such as have health, and who might maintain themselves, to be drones and live upon the labour
of others.

The bulk of such as are a burden to the public consists in the cottagers and paupers, beggars
in great cities and towns, and vagrants.

Upon a survey of the hearth books, made in Michaelmas, 1685, it was found that of the 1,300,000
houses in the whole kingdom, those of one chimney amounted to 554,631, but some of these having
land about them, in all our calculations, we have computed the cottagers but at 500,000 families;
but of these, a large number may get their own livelihood, and are no charge to the parish,
for which reason Mr. King very judiciously computes his cottagers and paupers, decreasing the
wealth of the nation but at 400,000 families, in which account he includes the poor-houses
in cities, towns, and villages, besides which he reckons 30,000 vagrants, and all these together
to make up 1,330,000 heads.

This is a very great proportion of the people to be a burden upon the other part, and is a
weight upon the land interest, of which the landed gentlemen must certainly be very sensible.
