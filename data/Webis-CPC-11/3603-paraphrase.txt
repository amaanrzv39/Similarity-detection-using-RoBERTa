One army cannot free the world. Even as one Roman legion is defeated by us, so another - bigger and stronger - arrives to cause more slaughter and mayhem. Vespasian, our great and noble master of the world, is the one we Batavians fight for. Yet, what a small group we are, compared to the whole of the human race. Is it so shameful to choose our masters? Would we not rather have a Roman emperor than a German priestess? The common people - the chieftains - will use harsher languate: "It was Civilis' lunacy that had driven them to war." Yet who does this war help? Has our limit been reached? Can we come to our senses and repent? And how but by punishing the culprit can this be achieved?

Civilis, tired of hardship and well aware of changed feelings, determined to forestall them. The bravest human spirit, he felt, had been weakened by the endless battles. As he crossed the bridge towards his opposite general, he thought "If I were defending myself before one of Vitellius' officers, I should expect nether pardon for my conduct nor credence for my words. Has there been anything but hatred between he and I? I think not."
