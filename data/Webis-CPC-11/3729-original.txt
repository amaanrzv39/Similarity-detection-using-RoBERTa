When the chief of the police saw this, he said to him, "What
is this, O accursed one?" "Give me the seal-ring of pardon!" replied he. "We are four who feign
ourselves blind and impose upon people, that we may enter houses and gaze upon women and contrive
for their corruption. In this way, we have gotten much money, even twelve thousand dirhems.
So I said to my comrades, 'Give me my share, three thousand dirhems.' But they fell on me and
beat me and took away my money, and I appeal to God and thee for protection; better thou have
my share than they. So, an thou wouldst know the truth of my words, beat each of the others
more than thou hast beaten me and he will surely open his eyes." The prefect bade begin with
my brother: so they bound him to the whipping-post,[FN#104] and the prefect said, "O rascals,
do ye abjure the gracious gifts of God and pretend to be blind?" "Allah! Allah!" cried my brother,
"by Allah, there is not one amongst us who can see!" Then they beat him, till he fainted and
the prefect said, "Leave him till he revives and then beat him again." And he caused each of
the others to be beaten with more than three hundred blows, whilst the sham blind man stood
by, saying to them, "Open your eyes, or you will be beaten anew." Then he said to the prefect,
"Send some one with me to fetch the money, for these fellows will not open their eyes, lest
they be put to shame before the folk." So the prefect sent to fetch the money and gave the
impostor three thousand dirhems to his pretended share.
