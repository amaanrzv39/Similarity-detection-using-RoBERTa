It is along such lines as these that our knowledge of the eugenic conditions of life will grow
adequate and precise enough to form an effective guide to social conduct. Nature, and a due
attention to laws of heredity in life, will then rank in equal honour to our eyes with nurture
or that attention to the environmental conditions of life which we already regard as so important.
A regard to nurture has led us to spend the greatest care on the preservation not only of the
fit but the unfit, while meantime it has wisely suggested to us the desirability of segregating
or even of sterilising the unfit. But the study of Nature leads us further and, as Galton said,
"Eugenics rests on bringing no more individuals into the world than can be properly cared for,
and these only of the best stocks."
