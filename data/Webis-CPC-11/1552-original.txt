    'It seems to me that your kind heart is pained by the thought of what
    your daughter may suffer if transplanted from a free and indulged
    home existence to a life of constraint and labour amongst strangers.
    Suffer she probably will; but take both comfort and courage, my dear
    sir, try to soothe your anxiety by this thought, which is not a
    fallacious one.  Hers will not be a barren suffering; she will gain
    by it largely; she will "sow in tears to reap in joy."
