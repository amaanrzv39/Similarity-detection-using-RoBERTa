With Goldsmith it is quite different. In The Vicar of Wakefield he seeks merely towards please his readers, and wants not towards  prove a theory; he glances onto life rather as a film towards be painted than as a complication towards be solved; his ambition is  towards design men and ladies many than towards vivisect them; his consultation is fundamentally dramatic, and his fresh seems  towards traverse naturally into the dramatic form. And towards me there is something very enjoyable within observing and contemplating the equivalent issue below different moods of art.
