In less than a century, besides telescopes,
microscopes, micrographs and telephones, the Royal Society will have to offer a premium for
such an etheroscope.

It is also necessary in connection with the question under reply that "An English F.T.S." should
know that the "Adepts" of the Good Law reject gravity as at present explained.  They deny that
the so-called "impact theory" is the only one that is tenable in the gravitation hypothesis.
They say, that if all efforts made by the physicists to connect it with ether, in order to
explain electric and magnetic distance-action have hitherto proved complete failures, it is
again due to the race ignorance of the ultimate states of matter in Nature, and, foremost of
all, of the real nature of the solar stuff.
