I was, moreover, perched
on the top of the wheel house, and reflecting on the poor taste of the author of the Book of
Revelation when he said that in heaven "there shall be no more sea." At this moment I came
to with a lurch. "She's stuck!" yelled, or as he himself would put it, "bawled," the Prophet.
For once he was undeniably right. Fortunately the tide was on the flood, and we floated off
a short while after.

In the afternoon we visited an Eskimo Moravian station. They--the Eskimos, not the Moravians--are
a jolly little people, and picturesque as possible. Not that any aspersions on the Moravians
are intended, for I have the greatest respect for them. My shining leather coat made a great
hit. They fondled it and stroked it, and coo-ed at it as if it were a new baby.
