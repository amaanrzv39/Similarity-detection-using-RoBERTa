Take the conviction with you to your homes that Germany will
stake her last man and her last penny for victory. Germany must conquer and will conquer.

Remember! That after a successful victory Germany will make new political and economical progress,
and that America, as a shrewd businesslike State and as a friend of Germany, will participate
in such progress.

Today we beg you earnestly to convey to your fellow-citizens that the German Nation, as the
safe refuge of civilization and culture, has always protected the loyal citizens of its enemies
in every manner in contrast to Russia, France, and Belgium. By circulating this short memorial
among your fellow-citizens you are likewise insuring that also in the future the United States
will learn the truth about Germany's battles and victories. Your friends here will always do
the best in their power to supply you with genuine news. We wish you a happy voyage toward
your home, so appreciated by all Germans, and hope to see you again in a victorious and prosperous
Germany.
