And yet to my mind this forgetfulness implies such a loss in the way of
experience, that if I could live my life over again I should devote at least half an hour a
day to the tedious task of recording the names and histories of the people I met, however uninteresting
they might appear.

What strange and complex annals I should possess had I kept such a list of my earliest school-friends,
supplementing it as time went on by any news of them that I could continue to obtain, and keeping
track, as best I might, of the principal changes in their lives! As it is, of the two or three
hundred lads that I knew there are but twenty or thirty whom I can recall, or with whose occupations
and whereabouts I am acquainted-- of the others I know absolutely nothing. For a few years
I kept them all vividly in mind; three hundred rosy faces smiled at me, three hundred schoolboy
jackets testified more or less distinctly to the paternal standing, from the velvet coat of
the mayor's son to the floury roundabout of the baker's offspring; I still heard all their
different voices; I saw where each one sat in school; I recalled their words, their attitudes,
their gestures. Gradually all the faces melted into a rosy blur, the jackets into a uniform
neutral tint; the gestures were blent in a vague ripple of movement, and at last a thick mist
enveloped all and the vision disappeared.

It grieves me that it should be so, and many a time I long to burst through the mist and evoke
the hidden vision.
