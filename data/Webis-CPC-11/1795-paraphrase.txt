This is exactly like a man, of course. 
Men overdo etiquette sometimes, because of a conservative fear of slipping up somewhere. There was a nice Red Cross major in France who had had no teaching in military matters, and had no arrogance whatever. So he used to salute all the privates and the M. P.'s before they had a chance. He was generally asking the road to anywhere or other, and they would stand staring after him thoughtfully until he was quite out of sight.
