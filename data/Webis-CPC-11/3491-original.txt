Then the tempters came and whispered of golden rewards, of eternal gratitude,
of fortune, honor; and these fiendish whispers misled my soul. I sold my honor and became a
traitor, and all this for the sake of gold! So I became what I now am. I do not reproach you
Rosa, for most likely it would have happened without you."

"But what danger threatens you now?" asked Rosa.

"The just punishment for a traitor," said he, hoarsely. "Give me some wine, Rosa, so that I
can gain strength to go to the king at once."

"To the king at this early hour?"

"And why not? Have I not been with him often at this hour, when I had important news or dispatches
to give him? So give me the wine, Rosa."

Rosa left the room, but returned almost instantly. He took the bottle from her and filled a
glass hastily.

"Now," said he, breathing deeply, "I feel that I live again. My blood flows freely through
my veins, and my heart is beating loudly. Now to the king!"

He stood before a glass for a moment to arrange his hair; then pressed a cold kiss upon Rosa's
pale, trembling lips, and left the room. With a firm, sure tread, he hurried through the halls
and chambers. No one stopped him, for no one was there to see him. In the king's antechamber
sat Deesen taking his breakfast.

"Is the king up?" asked Weingarten.

"The sun has been up for hours, and so of course the king is up," said Deesen, proudly.

"Announce me to his majesty; I have some important news for him."

He entered the king's chamber, and returned in a few moments for Weingarten.

The king was sitting in an arm-chair by a window, which he had opened to breathe the fresh
summer air. His white greyhound, Amalthea, lay at his feet, looking up at him with his soft
black eyes.
