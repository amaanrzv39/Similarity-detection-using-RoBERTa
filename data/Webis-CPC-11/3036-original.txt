HORACE BUSHNELL was a scholar, and wrote many
elaborate works on metaphysics and divinity; but the Bushnell Park of Hartford will probably
be that for which coming generations will thank him most. Certainly it will keep his memory
fragrant and green forever.

Our good city is justly famous for its hospitals and physicians, as well as its churches and
clergymen. I hope the contemplated parks may not supersede the sanctuary and the sermon, though,
as they say, there are "sermons in stones, and good in every thing." But certain it is, that
a ramble through green fields at any time, and along sparkling streams, is better than a sick-bed,
or the apothecary's drugs and doses.

We are all of us, I suppose, more or less subject to the blues, business-men, clergymen, and
even politicians.
