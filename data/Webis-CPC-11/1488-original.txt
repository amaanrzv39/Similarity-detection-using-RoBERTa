On the very day that this treaty was signed, Bismarck, in
answer to an Austrian despatch, wrote insisting that he had no intention of entering on an
offensive war against Austria. In private conversation he was more open; to Benedetti he said:
"I have at last succeeded in determining a King of Prussia to break the intimate relations
of his House with that of Austria, to conclude a treaty of alliance with Italy, to accept arrangements
with Imperial France; I am proud of the result."
