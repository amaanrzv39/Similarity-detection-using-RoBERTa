The Angel's daughters (pleasanter angels Mr. Idle and
Mr. Goodchild never saw, nor more quietly expert in their business, nor more superior to the
common vice of being above it), have a little time to rest, and to air their cheerful faces
among the flowers in the yard.  It is market-day.  The market looks unusually natural, comfortable,
and wholesome; the market-people too.  The town seems quite restored, when, hark! a metallic
bray--The Gong-donkey!

The wretched animal has not cleared off with the rest, but is here, under the window.  How
much more inconceivably drunk now, how much more begrimed of paw, how much more tight of calico
hide, how much more stained and daubed and dirty and dunghilly, from his horrible broom to
his tender toes, who shall say!  He cannot even shake the bray out of himself now, without
laying his cheek so near to the mud of the street, that he pitches over after delivering it.
Now, prone in the mud, and now backing himself up against shop-windows, the owners of which
come out in terror to remove him; now, in the drinking-shop, and now in the tobacconist's,
where he goes to buy tobacco, and makes his way into the parlour, and where he gets a cigar,
which in half-a-minute he forgets to smoke; now dancing, now dozing, now cursing, and now complimenting
My Lord, the Colonel, the Noble Captain, and Your Honourable Worship, the Gong-donkey kicks
up his heels, occasionally braying, until suddenly, he beholds the dearest friend he has in
the world coming down the street.
