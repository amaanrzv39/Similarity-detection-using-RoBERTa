I am the Malee's
wife, and coming here to gather flowers, I found you lying on the ground, and this your little
baby, who is dead; but come home with me, I will take care of you."

Panch-Phul Ranee answered, "Kind friend, this is not my baby; he did not die; he was the image
of his father, and fairer than this child. Someone must have taken him away, for but a little
while ago, I held him in my arms, and he was strong and well, while this one could never have
been more than a puny, weakly infant.
