[Footnote 8: It seems hard to understand how so useful an auxiliary to the surgeon as the ligature,--it
seems indispensable to us,--could possibly be allowed to go out of use and even be forgotten.
It will not be difficult, however, for anyone who recalls the conditions that obtained in old-time
surgery. The ligature is a most satisfying immediate resource in stopping bleeding from an
artery, but a septic ligature inevitably causes suppuration and almost inevitably leads to
secondary hemorrhage.
