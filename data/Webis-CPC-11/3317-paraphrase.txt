The King and his personal Band of Army put up a weak resisitance, but the rest of the army just fell easy to the Romans Attack even though the Roman army had very few weapons and an army of made of prisoners.

Later it came to known that the king had fled to the southern desert to Thala(1097) where his children had sought refuge with a few of his mounted soldiers and some Roman army deserters.Thala was known to be a wealthy town.This city was an ideal escape for the king a sit was around Thirteen miles east from the Capsa oasis and separated the king and the romans with a huge,dry desert in between them.never before had an roman army led an expedition across such a hostile territory which led the king to believev he was safe.The Romans were supposedly an civilised army who captured an territory and then settled and brought civilisation to that area. As Jugurtha had got power in thala he started to believe that his position was consolidated and there was some kind of political unrest in the roman squad and they might not change the idea of attacking Thala.
