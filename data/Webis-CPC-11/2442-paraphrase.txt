Carthach, also known as Mochuda, is a famous bishop from North Kerry belonging to the clan of
Fergus Mac Roigh.

This well-known man came from the line of the Ulster king who gave up his throne to a woman for one year but never got it back after the year was finished, so now his descendents are scattered throughout Ireland.
