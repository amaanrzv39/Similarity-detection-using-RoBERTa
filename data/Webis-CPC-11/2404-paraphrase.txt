In order to prove my point, I will cite only witnesses that the Atheist himself deems reliable, so that there will be no reason to suspect the credibility of said witnesses.  Obviously, the Atheist, who claims to be a reasonable person, will not reject his own thoughts and claims.  In fact, even further, the Atheist would not even try to hide the witness's testimony from being put forth, were he on a witness stand.
