If we were content to do so, he set us on a beast which he had
there ready, and carried us over churches and high walls, and after all he came to a green
meadow where Blockula lies [the Brockenberg in the Hartz forest, as Scott conjectures]. We
procured some scrapings of altars and filings of church clocks, and then he gave us a horn
with a salve in it, wherewith we do anoint ourselves, and a saddle, with a hammer and a wooden
nail thereby to fix the saddle.
