I have had of late no accesses either of bile or
of nervous affection, and by mixing exercise with literary labour, I have escaped the tremor
cordis which on other occasions has annoyed me cruelly. I went to the inspection of the Selkirkshire
Yeomanry, by Colonel Thornhill, 7th Hussars. The Colonel is a remarkably fine-looking man,
and has a good address. His brow bears token of the fatigues of war. He is a great falconer,
and has promised to fly his hawks on Friday for my amusement, and to spend the day at Abbotsford.
The young Duke of B. was on the field looking at the corps, most of whom are his tenants. They
did very well, and are fine, smart young men, and well mounted. Too few of them though, which
is a pity. The exercise is a work which in my time I have loved well.

Finished my task at night.

October 5.--I was thinking this morning that my time glided away in a singularly monotonous
manner, like one of those dark grey days which neither promise sunshine nor threaten rain;
too melancholy for enjoyment, too tranquil for repining. But this day has brought a change
which somewhat shakes my philosophy. I find by a letter from J. Gibson that I may go to London
without danger, and if I may, I in a manner must, to examine the papers in the Secretary of
State's office about Bon. when at Saint Helena. The opportunity having been offered must be
accepted, and yet I had much rather stay at home. Even the prospect of seeing Sophia and Lockhart
must be mingled with pain, yet this is foolish too. Lady Hamilton[350] writes me that Pozzo
di Borgo,[351] the Russian Minister at Paris, is willing to communicate to me some particulars
of Bonaparte's early life. Query--might I not go on there? In for a penny, in for a pound.
