The move could have been deemed a success, since before long both she and Avery happily fell in love with other people. Unfortunately, before the divorce could be granted, and they could live happily ever after with their new loves, Cecily was injured in an auto accident. The twisted fate that dropped her on the doorstep of her husband's practice and into his care, caused an entirely different outcome. What if Avery had been a dentist, accountant, or in some other profession? Would the fates conspired in some other way to give Avery the same advantages? This is a well-written story dealing with the human experience. When Dr. Avery says, "There's a lot of grippe in town, and it's a thing that isn't reported to the Health Department", it is right on the money.
