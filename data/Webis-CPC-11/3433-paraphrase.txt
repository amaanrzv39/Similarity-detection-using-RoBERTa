At four o'clock, gratified that no practical intent could be effected by going further away up the stream, we finished at a accumulation of huts called Las Sandias,--not inappropriately, for the total inclining bank of the waterway, which here seemed to be little better than a barren sand-bed, was included, for a quarter of a mile, with a luxuriant crop of water- and musk-melons, now in their perfection. We paid for as more as we could bear off for a real. They were full, affluent, and juicy, and confirmed to be a thankful restorative, after our day's exposure to the direct rays of the sun, and their scarcely less supportable reflection from the water. The melon-patch of Las Sandias is overflowed defying the rainy time of the year, and possibly the blatantly bare, sandy covering obscures affluent bank deposits of loam below.
We encountered the stream here vibrant with an energetic and blatantly voracious fish, varying in distance from fourteen to 20 inches, reddish in shade of color, and intimately resembling the Snapper of the Atlantic seaside area of Central America. The male inhabitants of Las Sandias were inhabited by in catching these fishes with hand-nets, in the rifts and currents; and the women were occupied in washing and drying them. Their offal had amassed throughout the huts in assault heaps, and granted out an odor which was virtually insupportable, but of which the women seemed to take no notice. We did not, consequently, trespass long on their hospitality, but returned to our vessel and commenced back to La Union.
