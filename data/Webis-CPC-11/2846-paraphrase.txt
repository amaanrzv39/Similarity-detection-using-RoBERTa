We spend so long worrying about how our Religion will affect the community that we have forgotten the soul of religion: the individual. We have here made that same mistake and come to believe that if a man is humane then he is religious. But this is false! A man is not religous unless he is devout. And anyway no person like us, the flawed good and evil type, is ever consistently humane, without the guidance of ever increasing gratitude to God! This is why no man has ever been abole to preach the living God without understanding the primary need in human life is to reconcile the conscience of the individual, and calm the wild anarchy of the life spiritual.
