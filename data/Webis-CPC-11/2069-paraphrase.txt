It was one of the incredible things about Jasmin, that he was never taken back by the radiant praises he received. Though enough to turn any poor man's head, he remained simple and natural to the end. As we say in this country, he could "carry corn". We have said that "Gascon" is often used in association with audacity or gasconading. But the term was in no way appropriate for Jasmin. He left the reverberation of praises behind him, and returned to Agen to enjoy the console of his fireside.
