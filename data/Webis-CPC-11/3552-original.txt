I would lock her best clothes up in that delightful carved oak chest that stands upstairs on
the landing and throw the key into the sea; and little Annie would let me do it; she is evidently
the most docile of child-women. Catherine, now, had I ever ventured on adverse criticism of
her garments, would have thrown me into the sea instead.

April 7.--Bank holiday, and wet, of course. The weather is never propitious on the feast of
St. Lubbock. The old Saints apparently owe a grudge to this latest addition to the calendar.
How beastly it must be in town, with the slushy streets and the beshuttered shops! How depressing
for Paterfamilias who arose at seven in the morning to set off with his wife and his brats
and the family food-basket to catch some early excursion train! How much more depressing for
him who has no train to catch, and nothing at all to do but worry through twelve mortal pleasure
hours!

St. Lubbock's malevolent influence doesn't fortunately extend down here, where everything seems
to work in time-worn ruts. I walked over the fields opposite. There were a great many new-dropped
lambs in the second meadow. They didn't appear to mind the drizzle, but kneeling with their
little front legs doubled under them, they sucked vigorously at their mothers, while their
long tails danced and quivered in the air.

There was one lamb lying quietly on its side. The ewe stood by, staring down at it with a sort
of quiescent curiosity from her brown, stupid, white-lashed eyes.
