Contact with certain molds can lead to serious health conditions.

Tilletia caries, primarily found in wheat, is most often found in bran and meal products. Ingesting it induces paralysis of the throat and spinal cord, as well as irritation of the gastro-intestinal tract.

Some rusts, notably Puccinia graminis and P. arudinacea, induce diarrhea and colic. More rarely, ingestion leads to full or partial throat-paralysis.
