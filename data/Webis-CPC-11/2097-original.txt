Each individual is trained to perform his part in a manner that will ensure the unity and harmony
of the entire industrial system of the planet, and each unit understands the dignity and importance
of his position, no matter what that position may be, for on Mars no activity of human endeavor
is considered menial; no one position in life is less important than the rest: all is God's work.

And so each gravitates to his special liking in the realm of physical activity, for God has
created each individual for some particular work.
