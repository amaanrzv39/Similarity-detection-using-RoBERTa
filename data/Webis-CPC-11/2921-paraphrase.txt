The marines are fighters. They have always been so. But it took their participation in this war to bring them prominently before the public.

   Ideas were very hazy. "Who and what are the marines?" was the question frequently asked when the communiques began to retail their exploits.   We all are by this time quite familiar with what they can do.

   Be it said that the United States Marine Corps was authorized by the Continental Congress on November 10, 1775, and therefore has the distinction of being the oldest military branch in the United States service. The corps served valiantly throughout the Revolutionary War. It was disbanded at the close of the war, April 11, 1782.
