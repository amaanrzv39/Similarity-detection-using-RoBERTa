Indeed, with the exception of death--confined almost entirely to the case of murder--it is
the only punishment bestowed on serious offences. Imprisonment of some kind, either at home
or in the colonies, is the penal safeguard of society; and we must be cautious that we do not
so far diminish its terrors, that it should cease to hold out any threat to a needy malefactor.
But before we allude to the discipline of the prison, we must take a glance at this great exception
of death, which it is the object of many of our zealous reformers entirely to erase from the
penal code.

That this extreme punishment should be reserved for the extreme crime of murder, seems generally
admitted; and the practice, if not the letter, of our law has conformed to this opinion.
