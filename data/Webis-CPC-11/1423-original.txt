While the profligate confines his sensual pleasures with such objects as I allude
to within the walls of his harem, the moralist has no right to trespass upon his privacy; it
is only when they are blazoned forth to public view, and daringly opposed to public scorn,
that the lash of the satirist is essentially useful, if not in correcting, at least in exposing
the systematic seducer, and putting the inexperienced and the virtuous on their guard against
the practice of profligacy.
