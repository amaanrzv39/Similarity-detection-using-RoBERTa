As Goethe's Mephistopheles explains to his witch:

       'Culture, which renders man less like an ape,
        Has also licked the devil into shape.'

Many interrogatories were put. Amongst others, how it was contrived that they could pass up
and down chimneys and through unbroken panes of glass (to which it was replied that the devil
removes all obstacles); how they were enabled to transport so many children at one time? Arrived
at Blockula, their diabolical initiation commenced.
