"Quite true, my dear," said Hans, in a low tone, rising and turning on his heel to walk toward
the back window.

"We had better go on, Mab; you have not given your full time to the lesson," said Mirah, in
a higher tone than usual. "Will you sing this again, or shall I sing it to you?"

"Oh, please sing it to me," said Mab, rejoiced to take no more notice of what had happened.

And Mirah immediately sang Lascia ch'io pianga, giving forth its melodious sobs and cries with
new fullness and energy. Hans paused in his walk and leaned against the mantel-piece, keeping
his eyes carefully away from his mother's. When Mirah had sung her last note and touched the
last chord, she rose and said, "I must go home now. Ezra expects me."

She gave her hand silently to Mrs. Meyrick and hung back a little, not daring to look at her,
instead of kissing her, as usual. But the little mother drew Mirah's face down to hers, and
said, soothingly, "God bless you, my dear." Mirah felt that she had committed an offense against
Mrs. Meyrick by angrily rebuking Hans, and mixed with the rest of her suffering was the sense
that she had shown something like a proud ingratitude, an unbecoming assertion of superiority.
And her friend had divined this compunction.

Meanwhile Hans had seized his wide-awake, and was ready to open the door.

"Now, Hans," said Mab, with what was really a sister's tenderness cunningly disguised, "you
are not going to walk home with Mirah. I am sure she would rather not. You are so dreadfully
disagreeable to-day."

"I shall go to take care of her, if she does not forbid me," said Hans, opening the door.

Mirah said nothing, and when he had opened the outer door for her and closed it behind him,
he walked by her side unforbidden.
