MISQUOTATIONS.

Mr. Editor, - poets misquoting offense is become so general, I would suggest that publishers print the advantage of index greater than are now offered to the public. For lack of them, newspapers sometimes make strange blunders. Times, for example, has recently more than once, given following a version known couplet: -

"Vice is a monster of so frightful expression that is ugly, but must be seen."

memory reader will no doubt instantly substitute for such hideous "so scary" and that, 'that'.

Same paper, a short time, as did the sad thing with Moore, as follows: -

"You may break, could ruin the vase if you will, but the smell of roses will hang it yet."

Moore does not say anything about perfumes Hanging vase. "Hanging" is an odious term, and destroying all feeling. What Moore does not really say is this: -

"You may break, could ruin the vase if you will, but the smell of roses will still stick around."

Now verse appears in its original beauty.

It is impossible to speak of poets without thinking of Shakspeare, which towers above them all. We have yet to find an editor capable of doing it full justice. Some of Johnson's notes are very funny, and the recent publishers occasionally cause a smile. Where once a mistake was made is persisted in.
