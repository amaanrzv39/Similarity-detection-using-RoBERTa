You are in an excellent job that gives you a social standing. Please resist alcohol or any other vice that may pull you down. Before you do anything, always think sensibly and from your heart. Please reply soon and let me know if I have bored you by writing such a long letter. You see, now that I am picking up the threads of my life, I am filled with love and a renewed vigor to reconnect with everyone who is dear to me.
