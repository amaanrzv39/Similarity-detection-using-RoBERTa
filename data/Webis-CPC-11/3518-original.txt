The Friday prayers should as a rule be attended in the mosque; but neither need there
be much devotion there; and, once performed, the rest of the day is free for pleasure or for
business.[59] The prohibition of wine is a restriction which was severely felt in the early
days of the faith; but it was not long before the universal sentiment (though eluded in some
quarters) supported it. The embargo upon games of chance was certainly unpopular; and the prohibition
of the receipt of interest was also an important limitation, tending as it did to shackle the
freedom of mercantile speculation; but they have been partially evaded on various pretexts.
The fast throughout the month of Ramzan was a severer test; but even this lasts only during
the day; and at night, from sunset till dawn, all restrictions are withdrawn, not only in respect
of food, but of all otherwise lawful gratifications.[60]

[Sidenote: Little that is unpopular in these ordinances.] There is nothing, therefore, in the
requirements and ordinances of Islam, excepting the fast, that is very irksome to humanity,
or which, as involving any material sacrifice, or the renunciation of the pleasures or indulgences
of life, should lead a man of the world to hesitate in embracing the new faith.

[Sidenote: Indulgences allowed in the matter of wives and concubines.] On the other hand, the
license allowed by the Koran between the sexes--at least in favor of the male sex--is so wide
that for such as have the means and the desire to take advantage of it there need be no limit
whatever to sexual indulgence. It is true that adultery is punishable by death and fornication
with stripes. But then the Koran gives the believer permission to have four wives at a time.
