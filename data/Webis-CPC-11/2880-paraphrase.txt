It has to be said that athough Angelina was not exactly fuming, she certainly seemed irritated. The day had been full of niggles, lots of little things going wrong:  one of her dresses had been badly ripped, the new hat she had ordered hadn't arrived, lessons were difficult, add to that an unrepeatable list of small desolations.  Thus she let vent to her emotions by crying, fussing and fuming, allowing herself to wallow in her misery.

Shortly after the tears, when there seemed a light on the horizon, her cousin Jeannnette Forrest burst inot the room and hugged her. Jeannette was all smiles and kisses.
