It is located about half a mile away from shore, where sand cover long climbs quickly to a height of about three hundred meters. This is approximately reached eighty feet wide, and resembles an amphitheater, as the walls of small rocks. Sounds coming from the ground at this place recur at intervals of approximately one hour. They at first like a low hum, but there ere long hear a sharp knock, somewhat like a bell stroke, and at the end of about five minutes, it becomes so powerful as to shake the sand.

Explain this curious phenomenon, given the Arabs, is that there is an underground monastery here, and that these sounds are those of the bell that rings for prayers monks. Thus, they call the "Nakous" which means bell. Arabs say that the noise scares them so when I hear camels to make them angry. Sound philosophers attribute to volcanic action repressed - likely to bubbling underground gas or vapor.

There are two types of extinct volcanoes: first, those in which all evidence of activity ceased entirely, and, secondly, those in which a vassal state of activity persist. The first are more widely distributed than the latter, but sometimes both kinds occur in the same district of the country.

OFF volcanoes are located in the Auvergne district of France. Solidified lava flows occur near Riom and Volvic crater where they came is still visible on top of the Puy de Nugere.
