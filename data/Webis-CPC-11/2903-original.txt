In this he succeeded so happily, that, after returning
to his own country, although his manner was a little dry and hard, he made many praiseworthy
works there; as may be seen from the choir of the Church of S. Domenico in Ferrara, wrought
entirely by his hand, from which it is evident that he used great diligence in his art and
put much labour into his works. In the guardaroba of the Lord Duke of Ferrara there are seen
portraits from life in many pictures by his hand, which are very well wrought and very lifelike.
In the houses of noblemen, likewise, there are works by his hand which are held in great veneration.

In the Church of S. Domenico at Ravenna, in the Chapel of S. Sebastiano, he painted the panel
in oil and certain scenes in fresco, which were much extolled.
