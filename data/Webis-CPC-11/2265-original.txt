Raw
materials are sent from the place of their origin to the fabricating establishment that consumes
them. In some cases, these distances are small, but when Cuba sends iron ore to the United
States, or when Brazil ships coffee to Europe, or when England sends coal to Italy, the distances
are considerable and the means of efficient transport are correspondingly important. The same
thing holds true of the marketing of finished products. Many of the goods turned out by the
present-day industry--particularly machinery--are very bulky and heavy.
