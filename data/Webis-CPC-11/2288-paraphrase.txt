I know not what the gentleman calls an expression of the public will. There were six candidates for the office of President, who were presented to the House of Representatives with equal suffrages. The constitution gave us the right & made it our duty to elect that six of the six whom they thought preferable. A public man is to notice the public will as constitutionally expressed. The gentleman from Virginia, & plenty of others, may have had their preference; but that preference of the public won't appear by its constitutional expression.
