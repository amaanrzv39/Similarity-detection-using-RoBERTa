A Cirro-Stratus cloud is one of our most beautific forms of clouds that glides along and attaches itself as if it were a parasite.

Twice, within the last two years while in New York City, the summer afternoons have displayed large masses of clouds sweeping in from the southwest, laying low in the sky, they could not be put into any previously described class or recognized as such by meterologists.  These grayish hemispherical forms of large diameter could be seen in great numbers, they hung vertically from a Stratus cloud or plane above them and seemed to be attached in some way.  They had a distinct yet regular shape and seemed to barely touch each other as they slid across the sky.
