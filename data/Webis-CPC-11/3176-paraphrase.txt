Such is three of the axioms in Mr. Harding's eighth edition of his valuable tiny "System of Short-Hand,"--to which, by way of pleasant illustration, they appends, the "Dirge on Miss LN G," copied by us from the "New Every month Magazine;" but they give Mr. H. credit for the present application. They could write a whole number of the MIRROR on the advantages of short-hand to the community; but as that would not be a practical illustration, they desist. Only think of the "Times" newspaper being scores of miles from town before half London has risen; and the Duke of Bedford, reading the previous night's debates at his breakfast table at Woburn Abbey. What would all Mr. Applegath's machinery do towards producing the newspaper without the aid of short-hand, which makes its expedition second only to thought.
