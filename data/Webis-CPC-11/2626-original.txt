It might not be surprising, if I lengthened my chain a link or two, and, in an age of relaxed
discipline, gave a trifling indulgence to my own notions. If that could be allowed, perhaps
I might sometimes (by accident, and without an unpardonable crime) trust as much to my own
very careful and very laborious, though perhaps somewhat purblind disquisitions, as to their
soaring, intuitive, eagle-eyed authority. But the modern liberty is a precious thing. It must
not be profaned by too vulgar an use. It belongs only to the chosen few, who are born to the
hereditary representation of the whole democracy, and who leave nothing at all, no, not the
offal, to us poor outcasts of the plebeian race.
