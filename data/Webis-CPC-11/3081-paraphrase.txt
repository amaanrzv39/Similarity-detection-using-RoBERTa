Willows are commonly planted by setting ten inch slips into soft ground to a depth of about eight inches. These should be arranged in straight rows four or six feet apart, with one foot between individuals slips within the row (except the green willow, which requires two feet spacing). Care should be taken to keep them away from weeds in the first two years, after which, they can be left on their own to grow. When the bark peels easily, the osiers can be cut and processed through a machine invented by J.Colby of Jonesville, Vermont, which removes the bark from up to two tonnes of wood per day, without damaging the wood itself. The profitablity of cultivation of different varieties differ by location.
