done with cream and a dash of beetroot in it, with cold meat, at lunch, for years.

"I heard something about it, yes. But aren't we to eat those we've got?"

"No, we must give them away. Remember, just cold mutton and salad. And no toast." You are getting
more confidence. "Never toast any more"--another light laugh--"never any more!"
