The temple is about 800 feet long.

About a mile and a quarter down the river is the ruins of Carnak, even in the present state overshadow that of Luxor.  One of these ruins is thought to be the temple of Ammon because of Diodoius's documentation of it being situated on this side of the river.  A mile long winding row of sphinxes paved the way between this temple and the northern entrance of the temple of Luxor.  This is but one of many extravagant roads into the city, maybe the largest city ever built, based upon plans as well as the personal accounts of Dr. Richardson and Mr. Hamilton.
