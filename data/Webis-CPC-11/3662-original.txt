"Gladly," said he, "will I keep this
tryst."  "Lord," said she, "remain in health, and be mindful that thou keep thy promise; and
now I will go hence."  Never can I do as thou sayest." "Bestow me upon him," said she, "and
I will cause that I shall never be his."  "By what means will that be?" asked Pwyll.  "In thy
hand will I give thee a small bag," said she.  "See that thou keep it well, and he will ask
of thee the banquet, and the feast, and the preparations which are not in thy power.  Unto
the hosts and the household will I give the feast.  And such will be thy answer respecting
this.  And as concerns myself, I will engage to become his bride this night twelvemonth.  And
at the end of the year be thou here," said she, "and bring this bag with thee, and let thy
hundred knights be in the orchard up yonder.  And when he is in the midst of joy and feasting,
come thou in by thyself, clad in ragged garments, and holding thy bag in thy hand, and ask
nothing but a bagful of food, and I will cause that if all the meat and liquor that are in
these seven Cantrevs were put into it, it would be no fuller than before.  And after a great
deal has been put therein, he will ask thee whether thy bag will ever be full.  Say thou then
that it never will, until a man of noble birth and of great wealth arise and press the food
in the bag with both his feet, saying, 'Enough has been put therein;' and I will cause him
to go and tread down the food in the bag, and when he does so, turn thou the bag, so that he
shall be up over his head in it, and then slip a knot upon the thongs of the bag. Let there
be also a good bugle horn about thy neck, and as soon as thou hast bound him in the bag, wind
thy horn, and let it be a signal between thee and thy knights.
