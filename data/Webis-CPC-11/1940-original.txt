Early in the year 1419, the Duke of Brittany, distrusting the power of France to defend him,
were the English to turn their arms against his territory, sought and obtained an alliance
with Henry; of whose just and honourable principles he had experienced practical proofs.

At this time the Spaniards added much to Henry's difficulties. Having engaged to succour the
Dauphin, they are said to have sent ships to Scotland for men, part of whom they probably landed
at Rochelle.
