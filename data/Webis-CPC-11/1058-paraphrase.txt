Don Jose's bedroom was dark, the shutters were closed air-tight.  He lay on his bed, made of wrought iron and adorned with fancy bedding and clean mosquito netting.  A silk scarf was wrapped around his head.  

We find Don Jose in a bedroom darkened by the necessary closing of the shutters, there being no other way of excluding the air. The bedsteads are of gilded iron, with luxurious bedding and spotless mosquito-nettings. His head is tied up with a silk handkerchief.
