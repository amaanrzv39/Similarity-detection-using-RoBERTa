There were no surgeons in Naples who attempted to restore mobility to my paralyzed legs. I lived because I have a great deal of vitality which helped to keep my spirits up and get on with life. Thus I came to Hellburgh and thus I remain, grotesque in body, but strong in mind. Perhaps because the highly placed lady should not be involved in the ugly process of trial, I was never made to stand trial to be sentenced, perhaps to die. And I continue to remain in Hellburgh.

I can never walk again. That is very sad and tragic. But how blissful it is just to feel the ground, sitting on it and be warmed by the summer sun; to pull down the branches of trees and smell the wonderful scent of the leaves warmed by the sun; to sniff the earthy smell of a tuft of grass pulled out from the soil that nurtured it. Such thrills never palled for me. It is so soothing to feel the earth in my hand and experience the comfort that only Mother Earth can give. A lump of earth in my hand gives me such peace, and all my weariness seems to vanish; and I feel cleansed and revived. But I know that the earth that I now hold in my hand will soon be my shroud and cover me all over. The lovely blossoms that delight my eyes now will grow above me, giving their beauty to decorate my grave. And I will lie snuggly in the bosom of Mother Earth.

I have, in my mind seen her face flushed and beautiful, her lovely golden hair caressing  her face as I rode beside her..
