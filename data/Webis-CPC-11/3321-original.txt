He was in the highest spirits. His talk was of rich farms, of immense gold-mines.
He was off to make his pile, and would then come home, buy an estate in the country--he had
one in his eye--and live a life of sport, surrounded by all the comforts, and by all his friends.
And so we parted, never to meet again. He was lost while making his way back to the coast with
a small party, and no trace of him has ever since been discovered. But to his friends he has
left a memory and an example of invincible courage, and unceasing cheerfulness in the face
of misfortune, of constant helpfulness, and unflinching staunchness. Can it be said that such

SIGNS OF THE SEASON.--"Beauty's Daughters!" These charming young ladies are to be obtained
for the small sum of one penny! as for this trifling amount,--unless there is a seasonably
extra charge,--you can purchase the Christmas Number of the Penny Illustrated, wherein Mr.
CLEMENT SCOTT "our dear departed" (on tour round the world--"globe-trotting"), leads off with
some good verses. Will he be chosen Laureate? He is away; and it is characteristic of a truly
great poet to be "absent." And the Editor, that undefeated story-teller, tells one of his best
stories in his best style, and gives us a delightful picture of Miss ELSIE NORMAN.
