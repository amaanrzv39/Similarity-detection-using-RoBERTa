Robert, educated as a doctor, went to Geneva, escaping the persecutions at the Sorbonne. Taking over the Paris press, he managed it from 1551 to 1561, printing one hundred volumes and being knighted as a king's printer. The example shown in the picture is the only known vellum copy of Robert's books. 

The photo shows the vellum book from the Woodhull Arms, stamped with gold engraving on the front cover. Signed inside: "Payne's sale.  Â£3 3s. M. Wodhull, Apr. 14, 1792."
