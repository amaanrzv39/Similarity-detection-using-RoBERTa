Therefore, it is no parity whatsoever between the two companies and their teachings. In the persecution of the Cathars with bitterness, the Church really acted in the public good. The State was obliged to help by force, unless you want to perish herself with the whole social order. This explains and justifies a certain degree the combined action of Church and State in the suppression of the Cathar heresy. In order that the French law in accordance with it, an oath was added to the coronation service at the time of Louis IX, in which the king swore to exterminate, that is, to banish all heretics from his kingdom. We are inclined to interpret in this sense the laws of Louis VIII (1226) and Louis IX (April 1228), to the south of France. The words refer to the punishment of heretics are a bit vague: "Let them be punished," says Louis VIII, "with the punishment they deserve." "Puniantur debited animosity. The penalties are other specified outrage and condemnation, in short, all the consequences of exile." [1]

Louis IX re-enacted this law in the following terms: "We decree that our lords and magistrates ... do his duty in the persecution of heretics." "In ipsis quod faciant debebunt propulsive." [1] These words in themselves are not very clear, and if we were to interpret the customs of a few years later, we might think that referred to the death penalty, including the fire, but comparing them with similar expressions used by Lucio III and Innocent III, we see that involve simply the penalty of banishment.
