My outfit was made up of three assistant engineers and paraphernalia that was secessary for three complete camps, 30 days' provisions (which actually ended up being 20) 11 carts and ponies, the ponies being very poor after a diet in the winter on buffalo grass and no grain. The 18th day of may was when I organized my division and camps in the order that they were to run. The country was litteraly under water dry ground was rare. My life's triumph was the fact that I got us across the country.

May 20 was when the blizzard set in. It lasted a full 24 gours, the snow was five inches, and the sloughs were frozen over with half of an inch of ice, a rather interesting event this winter, as he was far from the wood by 18 inches, so he lay in his blankets with a diet of hard tack.
