Most negroes
have high and narrow skulls. According to Welcker the average percentage of width begins at
68 and rises to 78. The variations are so great that, among eighteen heads from Equatorial
Africa, Barnard Davis found no less than four brachyrephals. In the majority dolichocephalism
is combined with a prominence of the upper jaw and an oblique position of the teeth, yet there
are whole nations which are purely mesognathous. It is to be regretted that in the opinion
of certain mistaken ethnologists, the negro was the ideal of every thing barbarous and beast-like.
They endeavoured to deny him any capability of improvement, and even disputed his position
as a man.
