"Rooms are not large enough students. Two students live day and night in one small room. Passages of recitation rooms are too narrow rooms are too small and not well ventilated .. Teachers have no support appropriate, and could easily get higher wages for less work in other institutions. For reasons of such an academy requires extensive equipment of $ 150,000 is needed for new buildings .. promise Thus, what has received only $ 36,000. If you receive a generous increase in funds it will flourish, if not, will not flourish as it should. Other institutions will attract its scientists. We expect that future instructors will have a spirit of self-denial equal to that of its present and past instructors.

"After his seventh of March speech, Daniel Webster said Bostonians, 'You have conquered your climate, you now have nothing to do but to conquer your prejudices."

Now Abbot Academy teachers were conquered, and there is nothing left to comply, unless the laws of nature. They are not subject to these laws.
