The letter you received was written without my knowledge or
consent. True it is that, terrified by my husband's threats, and in some measure reconciled
to the wicked imposition by knowing that, after all, the right child would be in his right
place, I afterwards lent myself to Danby's evil purposes. But I chiefly feared for my son,
whom I fully believed he would not have scrupled to make away with in revenge for my exposing
his profitable fraud.
