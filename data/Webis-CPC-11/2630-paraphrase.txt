The writings of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the other prophets should duly be called miracles because even though they write long before Christ was born they told us that there would come the day when the Saviour King would come and save the humanity.

The wall of Jerusalem would not hold. The city would be devastated. The Jews theirselves would suffer terribly. Even though all these horrible things would happen, God would come and save his people in the end.

When the predicted troubles came, the prophets were devastated, and their hearts were torn when they say their land being destroyed by the khafirs.
