It has been noticed for a long time, that the mere latitude in the arctic region is very far from being a certain indication of what degree of cold that might naturally be expected by a closer approach to the pole. For example, coldness is more intense in some parts of latitude 60 degrees than in 70 or even 77 degrees; even so this varies very much in different districts on the coastal area, and in different seasons.  We may remark in passing, that whenever there is a particularly normal winter in Britain, it is the complete other way around in the arctic regions; and so versa.  The astonishment of Captain Penny when the new polar sea was discovered in question was heightened by the truth, that it had a much warmer climate than in the southern latitudes, and that it had an amazing amount of fish, while its shores were enlivened with flocks of birds and even animals.
