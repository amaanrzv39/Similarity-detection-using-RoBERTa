here there is no report of the full development found in the urine, sputa or sweat. Again, Dr. B. or Dr. Safford didn't transmit the disease to unsafe persons by exposure. I felt gratified then that the Gemiasmas produces ague, it is then by no means proved that no other cryptogam might not produce malaria. I took note of the plants Dr. B. described, but deleted them from my account. I hope Dr. B. will follow this subject further, as I beleive this field is very large and the observers are few.
