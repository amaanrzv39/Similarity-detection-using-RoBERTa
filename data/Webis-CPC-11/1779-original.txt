It seemed to point so clearly, much as in music the sensitive seventh points to
the tonic, to a sort of resolution on the number nine. And if only nine could be established,
it would seem to explain so much.... For five being man's numeral in creation (and is not the
measurement of his face also five eyes?), it makes, when added to four, the number of the material
elements over which he dominates, nine, which would thus represent the supremacy or perfection
of man.
