Ashby-de-la-Zouch.

Palindromical Lines (Vol. vii., pp. 178. 366.).--Besides the habitats already given for the
Greek inscription on a font, I have notes of the like at Melton Mowbray; St. Mary's, Nottingham;
in the private chapel at Longley Castle; and at Hadleigh. At this last place, it is noted in
a church book to be taken out of Gregory Nazienzen (but I never could find it), and a reference
is made to Jeremy Taylor's Great Exemplar, "Discourse on Baptism," p. 120. sect. 17.
