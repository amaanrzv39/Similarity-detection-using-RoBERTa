But as a mere cottage roof, it cannot be sublime, and whatever sublimity
it derives from the wildness or sternness which the mountains have given it in its covering,
is, so far forth, parasitical. The mountain itself would have been grand, which is much more
than picturesque; but the cottage cannot be grand as such, and the parasitical grandeur which
it may possess by accidental qualities, is the character for which men have long agreed to
use the inaccurate word "Picturesque."
