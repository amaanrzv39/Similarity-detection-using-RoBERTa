When Arthur heard of this, he went to the North, and summoned Gwyn ap Nudd before him, and
set free the nobles whom he had put in prison, and made peace between Gwyn ap Nudd and Gwythyr
the son of Griedawl.  And this was the peace that was made: --that the maiden should remain
in her father's house, without advantage to either of them, and that Gwyn ap Nudd and Gwythyr
the son of Greidawl should fight for her every first of May, from thenceforth until the day
of doom, and that whichever of them should then be conqueror should have the maiden.
