Amid the carvings of these doorways are the heroes
and saints of the Old Testament, types and forerunners of the Messiah, as well as historic
scenes, representing the Redemption of the World, the Conversion of the Gentiles, the Resurrection
of the Dead, the Last Judgment, the Condemnation of the Wicked, the Reception of the Just into
the habitations of the blest. Finally, the Assumption and Coronation of the Blessed Virgin
sums up, with an imaginative legend, this series of Christian dogma perpetuated in stone.
