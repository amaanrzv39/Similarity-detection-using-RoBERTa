Two holes of about 6 feet depth and 8 inches diameter are made in the ice, in a direction from north to south.  A snpw mound of about 4 feet height  is formed at the southern edge of the northern hole, like a veil, such as it forms a half circle .  Also, at the northern edge of the southern hole, another mound is made , in such a way, that  the sun's rays are reflected through it. The water  which is entering through the southern part shines brightly due to the rays of Sun and flows through the northern opening.  Esquimaux  leans  near this northern opening and with a red string in his left hand attracts the fishes by sculling the water and with the spear in his right hand he pierces the fishes and catches them.  Likewise, they get as much as they need.
