During the highest water season it was not deep, only being ten feet; it's north end bordered a large swamp, and nearly all its bottom, all but right next to the shore, was made up of a mixture of an unsure depth of soft brown moldy mud. The water had a powerful color with peaty mixtures, has a muddy taste, and is around 70 degrees (Fahrenheit) at the bottom, being warmed by the sun itself. Although it is such an inviting place, salmon swam through the summer in complete health. It is believed that previous infictions received before arriving to the area caused the few losses that did occur.

* The bottom temperature through the month of August, 1872 did not go below 70 degrees, and was established to be 71 degrees for six days.
