Henry was a man who, in his public life, never delegated tasks to others if he thought he could do the work himself. He carried these ideas into his private life, leaving behind a pattern of Christian kindness, lowliness of mind, generosity, and true friendship, which both rich and poor alike strove to imitate. Bishop Courtenay was said to have been one of Henry's best friends, drawn to him by the singular qualities of mind and heart combined.
