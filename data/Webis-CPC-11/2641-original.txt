Study
of the tumors of mice show a slightly greater susceptibility to tumor formation in the progeny
of mice who have developed tumors. Studies of human families seem to show that heredity has
a slight influence, but in the frequency of tumors such statistical evidence is of little value.
The question of inheritance has much bearing on the origin of tumors. If the tumor is accidental
and due entirely to extraneous causes, inheritance is not probable; but if there is some predisposition
to tumor formation in certain individuals due to some peculiarity, then inheritance may exert
an influence.

The question as to whether tumors are an increasing cause of disease is equally difficult of
solution.
