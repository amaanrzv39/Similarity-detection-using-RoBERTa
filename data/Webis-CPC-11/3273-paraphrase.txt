Could be something that you wanted as long as hours of prayer were not violated. Agriculture, scholarships, education, handicraft and art were made perfect sons of St. Benedict, who works in love and want quiet. This is what one of the greatest minds of Christendom constructive regarded as a reasonable life, a framework in which the loftiest human faculties may increase, and the human spirit to achieve this harmony with God, which is its goal. In addition, this life was to be social. It was at first only the useful life of a farm occupied Italy, lived in groups - in monastic families, in accordance with the rule and not the inspiration for a Master, but an elder, a father who was really Monks's spiritual father, and tried to train them in humility, obedience, self-denial and flexibility gentle nature are genuine fruits of the Spirit. This ideal, it seems, still has something to tell us some quick reprimand to our administration and the existence of confusing, confusion of values, our inability to find time for reality. We'll find him and his creator, if you look, all these brands regenerate life of the Spirit which history has shown us as usual: ie transcendent purpose, balanced career action and contemplation, creative power, and above all the principle social solidarity and apprenticeship.
